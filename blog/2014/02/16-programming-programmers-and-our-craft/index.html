  <p>This is a <a href="http://vimeo.com/13914482">very nice interview (video)</a> with JB Rainsberger and
Corey Haines, two of the people I closely follow and try to learn from
as much as I can.</p>
<p>They are talking about the passion of being a programmer, how to become one
and how they think that a programmer can become better. They share
a lot of personal experience. Well worth your time.</p>
