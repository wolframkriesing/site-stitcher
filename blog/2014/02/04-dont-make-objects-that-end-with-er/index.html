  <p>I was about to write a &quot;Handler&quot; class. But I remembered that the &quot;er&quot; classes
are not so good.</p>
<p>And I mean, think about it. Even if it is a <code>RequestHandler</code> 
it still can do lots of things and can have many reasons to change, which breaks
the Single Responsibility Principle.
So I searched for it and found <a href="http://objology.blogspot.de/2011/09/one-of-best-bits-of-programming-advice.html">this article</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the jst of OOP is that we bind behavior to data</p>
</blockquote>
<p>noted</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in nearly every &quot;er&quot; object case, there was a better name for it. And that giving it a better name would tend to make the design more encapsulated, less spaghetti code, in short more object oriented</p>
</blockquote>
<p>now we are getting to the meat :)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take some sort of &quot;Loader&quot; for example. The focus here is on the unit of work it does. 
[...] Now instead replace that with a LoadRecord and a LoadStream. 
I&#39;m reasonably confident you&#39;ll end up with something that is more akin to what the 
original Founding Fathers of OOP had in mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A simple example: Loader =&gt; LoadRecord</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Until you apply the mindset for a while though, you&#39;ll never really know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is so true for a lot of things, and also a good reason why I do believe that
katas have a value.<br>Just <a href="http://objology.blogspot.de/2011/09/one-of-best-bits-of-programming-advice.html">read the article</a>, it&#39;s quite short and compact but has some nice examples in it.</p>
