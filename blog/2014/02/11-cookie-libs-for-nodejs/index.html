  <p>If you want to dive into cookies, here is the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265">RFC6265</a>. I was looking around for some decent cookie libraries. There seem to be some
of them.</p>
<p>And it is very irritating that some are as young as from last year.
I thought this topic is old enough so that there is one standard solution
and done. But I seem to be wrong. 
What all of them have in common is their quality of testing is quite interesting.
From nothing at all to hard core integration tests. Lot&#39;s of potential for 
refactoring projects.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jshttp/cookie">https://github.com/jshttp/cookie</a><br>The simplest cookie lib ever, I guess. Also great for understanding cookies well,
if it is complete - I don&#39;t know.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cookie is a basic cookie parser and serializer. It doesn&#39;t make assumptions about how you are going to deal with your cookies. It basically just provides a way to read and write the HTTP cookie headers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Ajnasz/ajncookie">https://github.com/Ajnasz/ajncookie</a><br>Basically the same feature set as the one above, though I really like
the API, it&#39;s so close to the request/response.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A very simple cookie manager</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pillarjs/cookies">https://github.com/pillarjs/cookies</a><br>Seems to be pretty complex. Uses Keygrip underneath, so the actual lib is quite small. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cookies is a node.js module for getting and setting HTTP(S) cookies. Cookies can be signed to prevent tampering, using Keygrip. It can be used with the built-in node.js HTTP library, or as Connect/Express middleware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/goinstant/tough-cookie">https://github.com/goinstant/tough-cookie</a><br>The biggest one, that even implements cookieJar (a way to bundle and kinda anonymize/hide cookies). </p>

<p>RFC6265 Cookies and CookieJar for Node.js</p>
