  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVSNsAei0VE">a talk by Chad Fowler</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Software gets too complex, tests slow, test coverage doesn&#39;t make you feel good, so you deploy less.
The less often you deploy the scarrier it becomes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was just about to quote him on</p>
<blockquote>
<p>comments are a code smell, there is just no way to validate them</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which I strongly agree on. And just one sentence later he says this</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tests are also a design smell. If you find yourself more time in your tests,
and I don&#39;t mean in the design of your system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which I just can&#39;t follow along. Because I think the test as your first user of the
code is doing exactly that for you &quot;driving your design&quot;. Especially when your code is so
small and modular that you think you are doing great design that&#39;s when a test
is so easy to write and a simple way to also verify the code later (as opposed to comments)
which is the value the tests add. They serve as the docs for what your tiny-modules-composition
does, they allow others to go in change requirements and learn where they have to be implemented.
And so on. Don&#39;t they? Maybe I will get to that stage of understanding it at some point.</p>
<p>And Chad saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My intention is to write code that can&#39;t possibly break.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I admire him! I think I still have lot&#39;s to learn.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TDD is a great way to do design, but it is not a great way to prevent bugs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think we agree basically :)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVSNsAei0VE">Watch his talk</a>, it is really very good and contains enough brain food!</p>
