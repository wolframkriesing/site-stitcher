<p>I am sure my uxebu-partner <a href="http://twitter.com/tklipstein">@Tobias</a> posted this link in our internal <a href="http://flowdock.com">flowdock</a> (never used it? do it now! it&#39;s Slack in better).
<a href="http://twitter.com/tklipstein">@Tobias</a> knows all the tools.</p>
<p>And we at <a href="http://uxebu.com">uxebu</a> are not so big grunt, gulp, etc. fans we rather let npm do the jobs that
it just does well, so here are some pieces extracted from a great article about how to use <a href="http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/how-to-use-npm-as-a-build-tool/">npm as build tool</a>.</p>
<p>This pretty much sumarizes what you are going to read, if you follow <a href="http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/how-to-use-npm-as-a-build-tool/">this link</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>some developers were brazen enough to present me with a Gruntfile and say &quot;how could this be done in npm?!&quot;. I thought I&#39;d pull out how-tos from the original draft and make a new post, just focussing on how to do these common tasks with npm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Windows always comes in the way again, there are some good tips here how to work around it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) Rather than relying on built in commands, you could simply use alternatives - for example instead of using rm, use the npm rimraf package.<br>2) Rather than trying to use syntax that is not cross compatible, stick to just the above ones. You&#39;d be surprised just how much you can get done with just &amp;&amp;, &gt;, |, and &lt;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally glob&#39;s <code>**</code> deciphered, for me :)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>such as *.js and expand the stars out as wildcards. Using two stars allows it to search recursively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Version bumping is baked into NPM.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This actually comes baked into npm (it is a package manager after all). Simply run npm version patch to increment the patch number (e.g. 1.1.1 -&gt; 1.1.2), npm version minor to increment the minor version number (e.g. 1.1.1 -&gt; 1.2.0) or npm version major (e.g. 1.1.1 -&gt; 2.0.0).</p>
