<h1 id="microkanrens">Microkanrens</h1>
<p>I first heard <a href="https://twitter.com/bodil">@bodil</a> talk at the 2014 craftconf in Budapest where I saw her presentation 
where she was live coding in at least 10 languages on stage. </p>
<p>Of course I started following
her on twitter back then and from time to time I recap her tweets just to see what
other interesting are out there in the world of functional stuff that I should look 
at. And there surely is always enough of it that I either never have heard of or that
will cost me another couple of unplanned days to dive into in order to not feel so stupid
anymore :).</p>
<p>Another thing she just posted, I guess preparing for another talk, is <a href="https://github.com/bodil/microkanrens">Âµkanrens</a>.
They are inspired by <a href="http://minikanren.org/">minikanren</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>an embedded Domain Specific Language for logic programming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I actually came across because I was once again hunting ES6 stuff. And found 
<a href="https://github.com/bodil/microkanrens/blob/master/mk.js">some beautiful code in her repo</a>. And I had thought I used many of the new ES6 features :).</p>
