  <p><a href="https://github.com/wolframkriesing/test-stitcher">TestStitcher</a> can now not only handle one file but any number of files
(see <a href="https://github.com/wolframkriesing/test-stitcher/commit/c885965fe81529e38a0577d76f87f5faa74191e1">the commit that finished it</a>) and show the tests in a structured way, 
see <a href="https://github.com/wolframkriesing/test-stitcher#test-stitcher">the README</a> for all details.</p>
<p>While doing that I discovered that passing too many argument to the file seems
to stop at some point, it just doesn&#39;t do anything. Reading <a href="https://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/argmax/">here</a> this seems
not to be the issue, I ran <code>getconf ARG_MAX</code> and it&#39;s above 200k, 
so that should not have been the issue.
Anyways, thinking about it for a while I thought of making TestStitcher read a 
<code>.test-stitcher.config.json</code> of a project, which lists all files that shall be read by TestStitcher. 
In the future it might also contain whatever configurations.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-teststitcher">What is TestStitcher?</h2>
<p>Test stitcher, a small project that I had in my head for years, is taking shape.
Test-sticher reads test files and spits out the test descriptions in a structured 
way. I am a big fan of readable and useful tests. Starting with well structured
test descriptions sounds like a great start. But that is just the start, I got
quite some ideas and a vision behind this one, watch this site for more info.</p>
