    <p>I am taking some notes here, basically for deeper learning and reminding me of knowledge.
If it is helpful for others, cool.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.testjssummit.com/">It</a> 
just started. I warmed up talking to Jacek, we both thought it starts at 15:00
but it didn&#39;t so it gave us 1h to warm up.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Wow, more then 5000 participants.
I guess that is the advantage of online conferences, the number of people joining
is basically unlimited.</p>
<p>They have all kinda stuff set up, discord (a chat), spatial (a kinda virtual env where you can work around)
and of course you can watch the video in live.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="talk-1-evolution-of-browser-testing">Talk 1: Evolution of Browser Testing</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bromann">@Christian Bromann</a> 
from Saucelabs starts with a 25min talk on how browser 
automation has evolved over the last year. So I expect a high level overview.
Let&#39;s see if there is something to learn.<br>Half in he very well explained the history and also the tech setups of all the browser
testing tools.</p>
<p>I start to get the feeling that the conference is going to be <strong>just about browser testing (?)</strong>,
which I would call integration testing. I am not sure this is going to satisfy what
I expected from &quot;Test JS Summit&quot;. That makes me think about what I did expect.
I beleive I expect to hear about good testing approaches, which start at a lower level
for me. I actually see testing more as a way of driving code, which means drive design
and architecture of a software.</p>
<p>Aha, he is introducing <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webdriver-bidi">webdrive-bidi</a> now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WebDriver BiDi is a proposed bidirectional protocol for browser automation, building on and extending WebDriver.</p>
<p>WebDriver BiDi is not ready.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Christian is saying &quot;you can finally talk to your Safari-friend&quot;.
Seeing the latest focus that Apple puts on browser development I would not be so sure that
they will help us on that front.</p>
<p>I am glad that there are things moving forward in the space of browser testing.</p>
<p>In the Q&amp;A at the end the question came up &quot;How can I prevent the <code>waitForElement()</code>?&quot;.
Christian says &quot;it is something that you need there&quot;.
This is what I also see as the main issue, it causes lags, flaky tests, devs pulling out their hair
and tests to become hard to maintain. I have no solution either, I am also thinking about this
for years already ;).</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="talk-2-its-not-about-your-assertion-library">Talk 2: It&#39;s not About Your Assertion Library</h2>
<p>Now <a href="https://twitter.com/novemberborn">@Mark</a>,
maintainer of <a href="https://github.com/avajs/ava">ava</a>, 
starts by giving a different talk. Cool.
The headline sounds like this will meet my expectations, he will talk about how to test,
not the painful browser testing.</p>
<p>The talk was not about assertion libraries or anything alike, it was an even higher
level talk. Ok. I didn&#39;t expect that either.<br>Still it was very good to have this kind of talk, we don&#39;t talk about why and how to test
right often enough. Still it felt a bit like he was not able to find the rights words
to get through to me, but I know what he means. ü§î</p>
<p>Mark says in the after-talk Q&amp;A.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Back in the days, before docker, when you installed node on your machine ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks ;).</p>
<p>In the Q&amp;A &quot;What is your definition of integration tests?&quot;.
Define it yourself. Align with your team what are the right tests for your product
and call them whatever you want.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="sponsoring">Sponsoring</h2>
<p>What? There are companies that really label themselves to do 
&quot;Enterprise Jamstack Websites&quot;? Wow, what happens when the Jam is not sweet anymore?
Pffff... ü§∑üèΩ</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="talk-3-your-tests-lack-vision">Talk 3: Your Tests Lack Vision</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/techgirl1908">Angie Jones</a>
starts with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubNF9QNEQLA&amp;t=15s">a video on inattentional blindness</a>, 
which already makes very clear where she is going (since I know what applitools does).
Then comes a lot of slides for nodding, especially if you have done visual testing a couple 
of times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you are writing your tests, you are scripting in your inattentional blindness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She came across a broken website, and then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I did what any of you would do, I opened the dev tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love that. She still finished the process but also mentioned that she thought
about the non-devs that don&#39;t even know about devtools. Yo yo.</p>
<p>She is getting her point across quite well, she bascially sells the AI browser testing
approach the company she works for does. I am totally on board and I think this
is a very good way to do it, hence 
<a href="/tidbits/2020/08/machine-learning-vs-screenshot-comparing/">my ML tidbit on &quot;Machine Learning vs. Screenshot Comparing&quot;</a>.
I just can&#39;t stop having the impression that this is more of a sales talk
than a talk for a conference.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="panel-discussion">Panel Discussion</h2>
<p>The moderator Yoni Goldberg is throwing some numbers in the room, I like that to
get a feeling for the speed in the field of testing javascript.</p>
<p>First question is about Github Actions. Kent C. Dodds touches on the monopolistic
trend just briefly, not enough I think. I have my problems with github actions being
so dominating. I have a <a href="/blog/2020/06/26-why-move-to-codeberg/">draft post</a> 
that was triggered by me learning github actions,
leading to go to codeberg (without having anything like github actions).
The marketplace makes it &quot;open source&quot; was a sense I got from the discussion, I am not
sure I can agree.</p>
<p>Also here it sounds like the browser testing is what people like a lot.
Unit tests are always mentioned on the side, but I am not sure it gets the love
it should. Maybe I just have an old style view on this.</p>
<p>Oren says &quot;integration testing you get high coverage really fast&quot;, without
touching on the tradeoffs. Then he mentions that he also hates flakiness and
prefers 20% of his code tested and be reliable, over 100% tested but flaky.
Later he does state the big difference of testing at the top of the test pyramid
and at the bottom. Well done.</p>
<p>Jason Palmer says &quot;keeping quality high pays dividence over time&quot;. <em>nodding hard</em></p>
<p>&quot;When should I write a unit test?&quot; and &quot;What is a component test?&quot; Yoni asks the panel.
Kent states that more integration tests prevent needing unit tests (how I heard it). Aha.
Though he also says that algorithmic things (as he calls them) are 
where he sees unit tests being needed.
Yet another time that I understand that we don&#39;t really have the same view
on testing.</p>
<p>Nancy says it: &quot;integration tests is a term we are not aligned on&quot;. I agree.</p>
<p>Mmmh, Yoni summarizes the panel kinda like this: test on the user&#39;s side, 
network and UI! And (he said) we still have the &quot;old tools&quot; like 
unit testing.
And that gives me food for thought, having learned testing from 
JB Rainsberger&#39;s and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDfX44fZoMc">Integrated Tests Are A Scam</a>.
Do I look at it from the wrong angle. But the test quality I have seen 
in the last years and I see in most places is so low, that I am not sure
we are on the right track dismissing testing the small things and just 
testing from the user&#39;s chair.</p>
<p>I need a break ... bbl</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="talk-x-contract-testing-with-pactio">Talk X: Contract Testing with pact.io</h2>
<p>Matt Fellows shows us how integration tests actually will fail you when your system grows.
Thanks. I am not loosing faith.
Yep, contract tests, this is the thing we want between parts of our system.</p>
<p>Ok, I realize the integration tests things like *-testing-library
is a different flight level to what pact.io and the integration tests Matt talked about.</p>
<p>Matt says it &quot;End to End Testing means too many things&quot;.
Where does contract testing fits in the test pyramid? It&#39;s rather close to a 
unit test Matt says. On the provider side it sits more in the middle of the pyramid.
&quot;They are closer to unit tests, but they still run through a couple layers&quot;.
&quot;Contract tests removes tests from the end-to-end test.&quot; Matt says in the Q&amp;As.</p>
