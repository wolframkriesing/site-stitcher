  <p>surge.sh - gh-pages.next?</p>
<p><a href="https://surge.sh/">The site</a> states that it is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zero-bullshit, single–command, bring your own source control web publishing CDN.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/surge-sh/introducing-surge-the-cdn-for-front-end-developers-b4a50a61bcfc">On the blog post</a> it reveals a bit more interesting information, imho.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Existing publishing solutions such as Github Pages and Amazon S3 were developed prior to the recent changes in client-side web development practices and thus didn’t have front-end developers in mind when they were built. These services leave a lot to be desired when it comes to deploying static web projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I expect to find what it can do beyond gh-pages, etc. And that&#39;s what it says.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With surge you effortlessly get things like…</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom 404.html files.</li>
<li>Catch-all 200.html files (for PushState apps).</li>
<li>SSL.</li>
<li>Indifferent (intelligently) about trailing slashes (“/”).</li>
<li>Clean URLs (indifferent about trailing .html).</li>
<li>Far-future expire headers.</li>
<li>Easy collaboration built right in.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>To me all this seems like something that gh-pages can do too, it just requires a bit
of setup. What do I miss? I guess I just expected much more :).</p>
