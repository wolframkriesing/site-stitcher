<p>Pharo - object-oriented programming language and a powerful environment</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pharo is a pure object-oriented programming language and a powerful environment, focused on simplicity and immediate feedback (think IDE and OS rolled into one).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the discussion about refactoring etc. at the <a href="http://agiletuesday.org">Agile Tuesday</a> someone mentioned 
<a href="http://pharo.org/">Pharo</a> which is supposed to be quite advanced in all things, just as the quote above 
mentions. Just watching the first 10min of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nmcou_5um2s">this video</a> was enough to be convinced that this
looks really interesting, I am adding it to my &quot;must watch&quot; list :).</p>
