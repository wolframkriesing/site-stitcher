<p>In &quot;<strong><em>[Our Best Practices for Writing React Components][react-practices]</em></strong>&quot; [Scott Domes][scott-domes] writes how he and his colleagues write React components. The post goes quite into detail about how to use what. I suggest pick what is useful and learn what is not. For those who enjoy reading discussion threads this is a treat too :).

<p>WebStorm IDE has received some <strong><em>automation features for imports</em></strong>. We are getting closer to doing less tedious work, bit by bit. JetBrains announced it [via twitter &quot;Sort and clean up your imports with Optimize import (Ctrl-Alt-O) and new code options for JavaScript and TypeScript imports&quot;][imports-webstorm].

<p><strong><em>[Next.js is a minimalistic framework for server-rendered React applications][next2]</em></strong>. To be honest, I didn&#39;t quite understand yet what it does. I saw the buzz around it. But I am not sure if it is just a scaffolding tool bundled with other tools, more or something different.

<p><strong><em>[Angular version 4.0.0 - invisible-makeover - is now available.][angular4]</em></strong> Did you think Angular2 is the latest? You are right, they just switched to semantic versioning, that&#39;s why v4 is a v2 :). I have never really used it, but Angular is relevant nowadays.

<p>The japanese railway staff uses a <strong><em>[point-and-call] system to prevent (or at least) reduce the number of errors</em></strong> they (can) make. They simply combine a physical action, the gesture (pointing) with their duty. For example a speed check is done by pointing at the speedometer and saying out loud &quot;speed check, 80&quot;. [Why? Read in this article.][point-and-call] Is there anything we can learn from that for IT (business)?

<p>[Martin] just reminded me about what pair programming is about. &quot;<strong><em>Pair Programming strategy isn´t &#39;go faster&#39;, it´s &#39;waste less&#39; (which often results in going faster)</em></strong>&quot; - Kent Beck. Thanks for the [instructional drawing by Martin Ruprecht][rupis-tweets].

<p>[Josh Begley][josh] wrote an app that sends a push notification every time a US drone strikes. But that was not as easy as pushing it in the store, Apple has quite an opinion about it. [Read an article about it][apple-metadata-drones-app-accepted].

<p>If you can&#39;t make it this week to [SoCraTes Canaries][socracan] you might want to consider the [24th - 27th August 2017 in Soltau, Germany][socrates17]. The mother of all SoCraTes. An un-conference where people like you meet to discuss, shape and share everything regarding the craft of software engineering and more. I am going to the Canaries ;).
