  <p>This is newsletter #6 - about crafting (and) JavaScript - April 3rd, 2017. Every Monday you will receive a hand-selected collection of <strong>links about JavaScript and how to craft better software</strong>. Let&#39;s get started ...</p>
<h2 id="javascript">JavaScript</h2>
<p>In &quot;<strong><em><a href="https://engineering.musefind.com/our-best-practices-for-writing-react-components-dec3eb5c3fc8">Our Best Practices for Writing React Components</a></em></strong>&quot; <a href="https://twitter.com/scottdomes">Scott Domes</a> writes how he and his colleagues write React components. The post goes quite into detail about how to use what. I suggest pick what is useful and learn what is not. For those who enjoy reading discussion threads this is a treat too :).</p>
<p>WebStorm IDE has received some <strong><em>automation features for imports</em></strong>. We are getting closer to doing less tedious work, bit by bit. JetBrains announced it <a href="https://twitter.com/WebStormIDE/status/847047263696437248">via twitter &quot;Sort and clean up your imports with Optimize import (Ctrl-Alt-O) and new code options for JavaScript and TypeScript imports&quot;</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://zeit.co/blog/next2">Next.js is a minimalistic framework for server-rendered React applications</a></em></strong>. To be honest, I didn&#39;t quite understand yet what it does. I saw the buzz around it. But I am not sure if it is just a scaffolding tool bundled with other tools, more or something different.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://angularjs.blogspot.de/2017/03/angular-400-now-available.html">Angular version 4.0.0 - invisible-makeover - is now available.</a></em></strong> Did you think Angular2 is the latest? You are right, they just switched to semantic versioning, that&#39;s why v4 is a v2 :). I have never really used it, but Angular is relevant nowadays.</p>
<h2 id="crafting">Crafting</h2>
<p>The japanese railway staff uses a <strong><em><a href="http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/pointing-and-calling-japan-trains">point-and-call</a> system to prevent (or at least) reduce the number of errors</em></strong> they (can) make. They simply combine a physical action, the gesture (pointing) with their duty. For example a speed check is done by pointing at the speedometer and saying out loud &quot;speed check, 80&quot;. <a href="http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/pointing-and-calling-japan-trains">Why? Read in this article.</a> Is there anything we can learn from that for IT (business)?</p>
<p>[Martin] just reminded me about what pair programming is about. &quot;<strong><em>Pair Programming strategy isn´t &#39;go faster&#39;, it´s &#39;waste less&#39; (which often results in going faster)</em></strong>&quot; - Kent Beck. Thanks for the [instructional drawing by Martin Ruprecht][rupis-tweets].

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/joshbegley">Josh Begley</a> wrote an app that sends a push notification every time a US drone strikes. But that was not as easy as pushing it in the store, Apple has quite an opinion about it. <a href="http://www.thefader.com/2017/03/28/apple-metadata-drones-app-accepted">Read an article about it</a>.</p>
<p>If you can&#39;t make it this week to <a href="https://www.socracan.com/">SoCraTes Canaries</a> you might want to consider the <a href="https://www.socrates-conference.de/">24th - 27th August 2017 in Soltau, Germany</a>. The mother of all SoCraTes. An un-conference where people like you meet to discuss, shape and share everything regarding the craft of software engineering and more. I am going to the Canaries ;).</p>
