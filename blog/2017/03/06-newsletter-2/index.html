  <h1 id="newsletter-2">Newsletter #2</h1>
<p>Welcome to the newsletter #2 - about crafting (and) JavaScript - March 6th, 2017. Every Monday you will receive a hand-selected collection of <strong>links about JavaScript and how to craft better software</strong>. Let&#39;s get started ...</p>

<p><strong><em>Purescript series</em></strong> - I started a series about Purescript, in [the 1st post][ps#1] I try to explain why a strictly typed language, that compiles to nice JavaScript looks quite appealing. And in [the 2nd post][ps#2]  I show how to install Purescript with yarn and write a first tiny bit of code, with type annotations(!).
[ps#1]: <a href="http://picostitch.com/blog/2017/03/starting-with-purescript/">http://picostitch.com/blog/2017/03/starting-with-purescript/</a>

<p><strong><em>[WeakRefs][weakref]</em></strong> - make sure to have your litter picked up! *&quot;Weak references had their first – indirect – appearance in ES6, with the arrival of WeakMap and WeakSet.&quot;* The articles goes much more into details than this: *&quot;A weak reference is a reference that allows access to an object that has not yet been garbage collected, but does not prevent that object from being garbage collected.&quot;*

<p><strong><em>[TDD the RITE Way][tdd-rite]</em></strong> by [Eric Elliot][elliot] summarizes why and how to do TDD, including examples. A good read to learn about TDD and also to remember many things such as how a test must be made *&quot;You only need to see the salient bits — the stuff that matters for the particular test at hand.&quot;* and many more things. A good read.

<p><em>[&quot;Duplicating code and cleaning up later is MUCH harder than refactoring out the common parts and composing anew.&quot;][tweet]</em>, I tweeted and [Angel Jimenez‏] responded with one of Sandi Metz&#39; classic posts [The wrong abstraction][wrong-abstraction], make sure to read it. Inhale it!

<p><strong><em>[Fraktus]</em></strong> - A random german movie. If you care about electronic music and it&#39;s history, watch this movie without reading about it and have fun! I guess it exists in german only.
