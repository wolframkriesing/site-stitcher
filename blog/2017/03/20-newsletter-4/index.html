  <p>This is newsletter #4 - about crafting (and) JavaScript - March 20th, 2017. Every Monday you will receive a hand-selected collection of <strong>links about JavaScript and how to craft better software</strong>. Let&#39;s get started ...</p>
<h2 id="javascript">JavaScript</h2>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://blog.expo.io/sketch-a-playground-for-react-native-16b2401f44a2">Sketch — A Playground for React Native</a></em></strong> This is a pretty cool tool. Especially if you have never touched react-native, this is a perfect tool for just trying it out. You can <a href="https://sketch.expo.io/">write code or drag &#39;n drop code</a> and right away see the result on your device.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://eslint.org/blog/2017/03/eslint-v3.18.0-released">ESLint v3.18.0 released</a></em></strong> If you care about your code eslint is a tool you surely want to use. This version &quot;adds support for AST selectors&quot; which allows for simplifying the implementation of custom rules.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/how-to-use-classes-and-sleep-at-night-9af8de78ccb4">How to Use Classes and Sleep at Night</a></em></strong> is an interesting look at JS classes by <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov">Dan Abramov</a>. The introduction of &quot;real&quot; classes in ES6 started lots of discussion. Dan suggest his view, which rings with many people in the JS community.</p>
<p><a href="https://howlerjs.com/">Howler.js</a> is a library I found through <a href="https://twitter.com/ThorstenRinne/status/842367095291695104">Thorsten&#39;s tweet</a>, which <strong>*&quot;makes working with audio in JavaScript easy and reliable across all platforms&quot;*</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="crafting">Crafting</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/61483799">Michael Feathers talked</a> about <a href="https://github.com/michaelfeathers/delta-flora">delta flora</a>, a tool he once wrote to get more insight into your source code and it&#39;s history. <a href="https://codescene.io/showcase">CodeScene</a> looks a very promising tool which does exactly that. It might make sense to keep an eye on it.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://github.com/svenvc/ston/blob/master/ston-paper.md">STON - Smalltalk Object Notation</a></em></strong> reads to me as if this is a notation for typed JSON. JSON is one of the most common exchange formats, but it also lacks a lot of explicitness due to it&#39;s exclusively simple typing. Maybe STON could be an option for a more strict(er) typed exchange format.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/blog/2135-saved-replies">Github has saved replies</a>, I didn&#39;t know. If you are intensively using github issues and pull requests, there is a nice feature you might find helpful: &quot;saved replies&quot;. It&#39;s like canned responses in gmail. It can help with &quot;saving you a ton of time typing&quot;.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://vgaltes.com/teamwork/Avoid-pull-requests/">Avoid pull requests</a></em></strong> because they are &quot;a bad smell of team dynamics&quot; and I strongly agree with the author that &quot;pairing is much better than reviewing&quot;. And I agree also that &quot;pull requests are great, especially when your team is not colocated&quot;. But they are not all bad, especially in open source PRs are great, where people don&#39;t sit beside one another.</p>
