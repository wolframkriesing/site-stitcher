  <h1 id="newsletter-4">Newsletter #4</h1>
<p>This is newsletter #4 - about crafting (and) JavaScript - March 20th, 2017. Every Monday you will receive a hand-selected collection of <strong>links about JavaScript and how to craft better software</strong>. Let&#39;s get started ...</p>

<p><strong><em>[Sketch — A Playground for React Native][sketch-post]</em></strong> This is a pretty cool tool. Especially if you have never touched react-native, this is a perfect tool for just trying it out. You can [write code or drag &#39;n drop code][sketch] and right away see the result on your device.

<p><strong><em>[ESLint v3.18.0 released][eslint]</em></strong> If you care about your code eslint is a tool you surely want to use. This version &quot;adds support for AST selectors&quot; which allows for simplifying the implementation of custom rules.

<p><strong><em>[How to Use Classes and Sleep at Night][classes]</em></strong> is an interesting look at JS classes by [Dan Abramov][dan]. The introduction of &quot;real&quot; classes in ES6 started lots of discussion. Dan suggest his view, which rings with many people in the JS community.

<p>[Howler.js][howlerjs] is a library I found through [Thorsten&#39;s tweet][thorstens-tweet], which <strong>*&quot;makes working with audio in JavaScript easy and reliable across all platforms&quot;*</strong>.

<p>[Michael Feathers talked][mfeathers-talk] about [delta flora][delta-flora], a tool he once wrote to get more insight into your source code and it&#39;s history. [CodeScene][codescene] looks a very promising tool which does exactly that. It might make sense to keep an eye on it.

<p><strong><em>[STON - Smalltalk Object Notation][ston]</em></strong> reads to me as if this is a notation for typed JSON. JSON is one of the most common exchange formats, but it also lacks a lot of explicitness due to it&#39;s exclusively simple typing. Maybe STON could be an option for a more strict(er) typed exchange format.

<p>[Github has saved replies][saved-replies], I didn&#39;t know. If you are intensively using github issues and pull requests, there is a nice feature you might find helpful: &quot;saved replies&quot;. It&#39;s like canned responses in gmail. It can help with &quot;saving you a ton of time typing&quot;.

<p><strong><em>[Avoid pull requests][pr-post]</em></strong> because they are &quot;a bad smell of team dynamics&quot; and I strongly agree with the author that &quot;pairing is much better than reviewing&quot;. And I agree also that &quot;pull requests are great, especially when your team is not colocated&quot;. But they are not all bad, especially in open source PRs are great, where people don&#39;t sit beside one another.
