<p>While talking about type inference, functional programming and alikes [Nicole] suggested this talk [&quot;The Future of Front-end Development: A comparison&quot;][future-talk] to me. It&#39;s a run through the front-end world from JS, to TypeScript, Elm and on and on ... and it ends with a smiley matrix comparing them all :).

<p><strong><em>[Web Share is a proposed web API to enable a site to share data][webshare]</em></strong> it was [implemented in Chrome][webshare-chrome] in October 2016. Phil tried it out and [shares his experiences in a post][phils-post] he released lately.

<p><strong><em>[Node 7.6 Brings Default Async/Await Support][infoq-nodejs]</em></strong>. Well, the latest version is already 7.7.4. Anyways, I think it needs to be said &quot;async/await is not considered experimental anymore&quot;. This will make writing and especially reading async code much easier, but also easier to add hard-to-find bugs :).

<p>In <strong><em>[Automated Testing Strategy for a Microservices Architecture][auto-tests]</em></strong> [Emily Bache][emily] writes about &quot;the evolution of our automated end-to-end system tests&quot;. Finally we are in the age where we all agree that tests are code just like any other and it&#39;s worth to make it &quot;faster and easier to debug, as well as having less test code to maintain&quot;. Amen :).

<p>[Benjamin links][benjamin-tweet] to an &quot;awesome list of things, tips to consider when mentoring people&quot;. The link simply points to a [list of tweets][mentoring-tweets], or moments as twitter calls them where people share experience mentoring.

<p><strong><em>[Animista]</em></strong> is a helper for generating CSS animations. Nicely sorted by different animations such as scale, rotate, flip, slide and the ability to manually adjust each. It&#39;s kind of a wysiwyg animation generator. And it&#39;s that useable and simple that even I understood it right away.

<p>It was just a tiny twitter conversation that gave me food for thought for days. What about you? It went like this: First was [tweeted that &quot;there are many educators in React community but almost none send PRs to the docs.&quot;][dan-tweet] and it got [answered that &quot;Most time I spend on sth has to &#39;pay&#39; in some way&quot;][axel-tweet]. Two sides of the same medal? Feel free to give it some thought.
