  <p>This is newsletter #5 - about crafting (and) JavaScript - March 27th, 2017. Every Monday you will receive a hand-selected collection of <strong>links about JavaScript and how to craft better software</strong>. Let&#39;s get started ...</p>
<h2 id="javascript">JavaScript</h2>
<p>While talking about type inference, functional programming and alikes <a href="https://twitter.com/NicoleRauch">Nicole</a> suggested this talk <a href="http://bobkonf.de/2017/athiemann.html">&quot;The Future of Front-end Development: A comparison&quot;</a> to me. It&#39;s a run through the front-end world from JS, to TypeScript, Elm and on and on ... and it ends with a smiley matrix comparing them all :).</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://github.com/WICG/web-share/blob/master/docs/explainer.md">Web Share is a proposed web API to enable a site to share data</a></em></strong> it was <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/10/navigator-share">implemented in Chrome</a> in October 2016. Phil tried it out and <a href="https://philna.sh/blog/2017/03/14/the-web-share-api/">shares his experiences in a post</a> he released lately.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/02/node-76-async-await">Node 7.6 Brings Default Async/Await Support</a></em></strong>. Well, the latest version is already 7.7.4. Anyways, I think it needs to be said &quot;async/await is not considered experimental anymore&quot;. This will make writing and especially reading async code much easier, but also easier to add hard-to-find bugs :).</p>
<h2 id="crafting">Crafting</h2>
<p>In <strong><em><a href="http://www.methodsandtools.com/archive/testmicroservices.php">Automated Testing Strategy for a Microservices Architecture</a></em></strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/emilybache">Emily Bache</a> writes about &quot;the evolution of our automated end-to-end system tests&quot;. Finally we are in the age where we all agree that tests are code just like any other and it&#39;s worth to make it &quot;faster and easier to debug, as well as having less test code to maintain&quot;. Amen :).</p>
<p>[Benjamin links][benjamin-tweet] to an &quot;awesome list of things, tips to consider when mentoring people&quot;. The link simply points to a [list of tweets][mentoring-tweets], or moments as twitter calls them where people share experience mentoring.

<p><strong><em><a href="http://www.curry-on.org/2017">Curry On, a new and unusual non-profit conference focused on programming languages &amp; emerging challenges in industry</a></em></strong>, which will take place in Barcelona, still has it&#39;s <a href="http://www.curry-on.org/2017/call-for-presentations.html">call for presentations</a> open until the 14th April.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://animista.net/">Animista</a></em></strong> is a helper for generating CSS animations. Nicely sorted by different animations such as scale, rotate, flip, slide and the ability to manually adjust each. It&#39;s kind of a wysiwyg animation generator. And it&#39;s that useable and simple that even I understood it right away.</p>
<p>It was just a tiny twitter conversation that gave me food for thought for days. What about you? 
It went like this: First was <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/843638863906136064">tweeted that &quot;there are many educators in React community but almost none send PRs to the docs.&quot;</a> and it got <a href="https://twitter.com/rauschma/status/843736747733405697">answered that &quot;Most time I spend on sth has to &#39;pay&#39; in some way&quot;</a>. Two sides of the same medal? Feel free to give it some thought.</p>
