  <h1 id="newsletter-1">Newsletter #1</h1>
<p>Welcome to the newsletter #1 - about crafting (and) JavaScript - February 28th, 2017. Every Monday you will receive a hand-selected collection of <strong>links about JavaScript and how to craft better software</strong>. Let&#39;s get started ...</p>

<p>In [&quot;Fast Source Map Generation for React Native&quot;][fast-source-map-gen] David describes how he and others *&quot;improved source map generation for 1,758,618 single mappings from 3 seconds to 550 milliseconds by optimizing code for execution in v8.&quot;*

<p>[&quot;V8 has been improved and released version 5.7&quot;][v8-release], where the async performance of Promises has doubled and the speed of async functions has quadrupled, regexps have become 15% faster and two new String functions <code>padStart</code> and <code>padEnd</code> have been added. And great to see that date and time get some love with the function <code>Intl.DateTimeFormat.prototype.formatToParts</code> (read [more about it in ECMAScript 2017 spec][es2017-spec-date]).

<p>In [&quot;The Eff monad implemented in Flow&quot;][eff-monday-in-flow] gcanti shows how to use flowtype to be able to be more explicit about side effects in your code. He shows in a server-side app how you could wire up a signup route to the side effect of writing to a DB.

<p>Many contributors have taken Uncle Bob&#39;s clean code principles and adapted them for JavaScript, which says *&quot;[Clean Code concepts adapted for JavaScript][cc-guide] is not a style guide. It&#39;s a guide to producing readable, reusable, and refactorable software in JavaScript.&quot;*.

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/SamirTalwar">Samir</a> wrote <a href="https://github.com/SamirTalwar/Smoke">smoke</a> a small *&quot;integration test framework for console applications.&quot;<em>. Where he says *&quot;a test case consists of input and expected output. It is constructed of a number of files with the same name and different extensions.&quot;</em>, so if you want to run a script or program and test/compare it&#39;s output this tool might help. In the <a href="https://github.com/SamirTalwar/Smoke#origins">Origins</a> section of the readme file Samir describes well why he created this tool.</p>

<p>[Lifetimes of cryptographic hash functions][hash-lifetimes] visualises impressively that (most) hash functions have a lifetime before they get broken. And since git uses the SHA1 hash, which caused the latest noise, [Linus Torvalds states on the mailinglist][git-mail] that the impact on git is rather minor.

<p>It&#39;s always good to know [where to find the markdown syntax][markdown-syntax], so here is the link. I use markdown almost daily but still don&#39;t know all the special characters by heart yet.

<p>While writing this newsletter I wanted to know again how to do quoting right and <a href="https://letterpile.com/writing/Using-and-Citing-Sources-Correctly">found this article by Virginia Kearney</a>, where she basically states that *&quot;When you are writing on the web, you can mention the name of the source at the beginning of your quote, paraphrase or summary and then provide a link.&quot;*. So I hope I have done it right :).</p>
