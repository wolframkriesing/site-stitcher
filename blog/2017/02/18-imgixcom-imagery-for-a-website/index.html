  <h1 id="imgixcom---imagery-for-a-website">imgix.com - imagery for a website</h1>
<p>I just stumbled over <a href="https://imgix.com">https://imgix.com</a>  which looks like it could speed up a website building process and reduce the time one needs to invest in preparing images.</p>
<p>The one claim they have somewhere on their website</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Build your product, not the framework</p>
</blockquote>
<p>rang with me. It actually well summarizes what they say they offer.
Their service seems to go beyond hosting images on their CDN.
I skimmed over their site and they auto-crop for avatars including face
detection and auto-enhance image quality if desired.</p>
<p>What I don&#39;t get yet is how painless and really no-work this will be.
Sounds all good, but also sounds like I would just do the work somewhere else then on my computer.</p>
