  <p>ADR is a way to document decisions, reminds me of python&#39;s PEP.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/lsmith/status/824593370496565248">Lukas&#39; tweet</a> made me come across ADR for the first time
so I went to read the suggested <a href="http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions">blog post</a>.
And it just makes sense to document the decisions, a very simple
process is described in the blog post above and also exactly the
structure of how to go about it. I will keep this around and
maybe it can become one of the tools as the <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2012/02/mikado-method">Mikado method</a>
has become a normal thing for me to apply when programming
myself into the rabbit hole :).</p>
