<p>What the heck does <code>-%}</code> mean in a Jinja template?</p>
<p>By using Lektor I need to learn <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja</a>, the template engine used. And I have to say it has the addons that I had always wished for in Django&#39;s template language (swig). For example there is <code>else</code> for the <code>for</code> loop, which applies when there is nothing to loop over.</p>
<p>And while looking for a tag system I came across <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lektor-tags">lektor-tags</a> which looks like the tag power and simplicity I need. While trying to get it to run, I came across this piece of Jinja template:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jinja">{% for t in this.tags -%}
  #{{ t }}
{% endfor %}</code></pre>
<p>and I saw this typo in there <strong><code>-%}</code></strong>, so I removed the <code>-</code>, since I thought it was a typo. Later I saw it more often, even in an <code>if</code> and in <code>macro</code> and before <code>endmacro</code> too. So I figured it was not a typo. And it wasn&#39;t :).</p>
<p>So I started hunting the documentation. I found places where <code>-%}</code> was used but it was never described what the dash was for. Until I finally found it, of course by accident. In the <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.9/templates/#whitespace-control">Jinja docs in the chapter Whitespace Control</a> it says the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can also strip whitespace in templates by hand. If you add a minus sign (-) to the start or end of a block (e.g. a For tag), a comment, or a variable expression, the whitespaces before or after that block will be removed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jinja">{% for item in seq -%}
  {{ item }}
{%- endfor %}</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>What a blessing. Something we always wanted in a template language. I remember back in the django days, the verbose <code>{{ spaceless }}</code> was quite noisy. I think this is a smart, simple and great addition. I am just not sure if the trade-off in time I spent to figure out what the magic is good for could be improved. Suggestions and ideas welcome.</p>
