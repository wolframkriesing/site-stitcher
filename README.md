# site-stitcher

Others would call it static site generator.
But tbh, I don't know where it goes. 
Currently this tool serves for creating my website https://picostitch.com

## Develop

Use `./run.sh /bin/bash` and you have a docker container containing the environment needed
to run this project. In there you can `npm install` to install all node deps.
