We used jQuery to animate between the pages, where each page was a react component.
Nowadays a react app tries to get the entire app to be react as quickly as possible.

    <p>State management in react as it is most commonly spread among devs is suboptimal, I would say.
I just looked up my first react app, it&#39;s from 2014 and we used react to make working with HTML
in a &quot;normal&quot; DOM based page easier and code more readable. React didn&#39;t control all the page.
We used jQuery to animate between the pages, where each page was a react component.
Nowadays a react app tries to get the entire app to be react as quickly as possible.
Has it turned around, against us?</p>
<p>But let&#39;s look a bit into state management, some history and some opinions.
I just did this and watched a couple interesting videos.
I got stuck with <a href="https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand">Zustand</a> (not biased by a German name, definitely not)
suggested by <a href="https://twitter.com/benawad">@Ben</a>.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="choose-context-or-redux">Choose Context or Redux</h2>
<p>A very good very short video about when to choose Context or a state management library like redux.
He shows very well where using Context only starts to get inefficient.<br>6 minutes</p>
<iframe width="427" height="240" name="video" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/5gUHfe-ETuo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p><br/><br/></p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="redux-and-context-explained">Redux and Context Explained</h2>
<p>Here is a five minutes (starting at 3:35min up to 8:30min) rundown of redux and 
what the &quot;new&quot; Context API (in React since about v16.3) can do.<br>5 minutes</p>
<iframe width="427" height="240" name="video" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/qT-6yHhzHqw?start=215" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p><br/><br/></p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="from-history-to-what-to-use-next">From History to What to use Next</h2>
<p>He starts from exploring the history of the Context API, and he ends with the question
if you should use redux in a project you start today. Well done.<br>6 minutes</p>
<iframe width="427" height="240" name="video" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ws131BqvLRg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p><br/><br/></p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="the-three-types-of-state">The Three Types of State</h2>
<p>In this video Ben explains very well what three kind of states he sees in React apps.
He also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you are probably gonna be required to learn redux at some point, although I would recommend
to procastinate it as long as you can</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Made me smile. I succeeded in that too, I mean I know the theory and stuff, but ...<br>6 minutes</p>

<p>Youtube has annoyed me enough with ads. Back to coding ...</p>
