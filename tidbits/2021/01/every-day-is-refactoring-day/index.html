    <p>It is always good to remind oneself constantly how and why to do things.
Refactoring is one of the things that I see getting too little attention.
I don&#39;t mean in our sprints or tickets, I mean in our professional lifes.
<strong>Refactoring is a tool we have. Use it</strong> (right)! I guess &quot;right&quot; is more
often important than one thinks.</p>
<p>I was just reading <a href="https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/refactoring-not-on-the-backlog/">Ron Jeffries&#39; post on why refactoring does not belong in the
backlog</a>, 
which I had not seen before. Even though it sounds quite logical and makes no sense
to stop development for half a year just to refactor to a happy place, it is
discussed as an option, too often. Just don&#39;t!</p>
<p>One of my favourite quote (by Kent Beck) is:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    for each desired change, make the change easy (warning: this may be hard), 
    then make the easy change</p>&mdash; @KentBeck 
    <a href="https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/250733358307500032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2012</a>
</blockquote>

<p>It does take discipline not to run to the finish line as fast as one can, because &quot;it is just right there&quot;.
It does take discipline to take a step back and make the new puzzle piece fit.
Making it fit sometimes means adjusting the entire puzzle a bit.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" show-link-on-mouseover id="software-is-soft">Software is SOFT</h2>
<p>This is another one of my favourite sayings. Software is soft.
You can always massage software to where you need it now.
We rarely work on software where we know exactly what it will look like in the future.
We write most of software to support a (fast) changing business.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" show-link-on-mouseover id="ron-reminds">Ron Reminds</h2>
<p>Refactoring is part of the job every day. It is like renaming, like fixing indentation,
like optimizing imports, like compiling again, like learning a new language feature, it is
just like everything else, it is not a task that stands alone and should be done solely for
days or weeks.
Ron sums it up well, I think:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We improve the code where we work, and ignore the code where we don&#39;t have to work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By doing so we have NOT &quot;wasted effort on places that don&#39;t provide benefit&quot;.
This often means to just ignore some of the trash laying around. Yep, there is trade offs
everywhere. It takes discipline to not refactor everything and touch all places once
one found a thing that should be ironed out. </p>
<p>Going into extremes and cleaning the heck out of code is good when practicing, but
at some point we also want to contribute and help moving things forward with our team, 
and then refactoring might not always be needed as much as a developer would like to.</p>
<p>I love how Ron ends his article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is how you do it.</p>
</blockquote>
