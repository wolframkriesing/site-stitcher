    <p>The setup is working, I can compile and run ReScript files, I touched a bit
on the syntax in <a href="../learning-rescript-part-2">Part 2</a>, next I will continue through 
the docs chapters from top to bottom.</p>

<h2 is="more-h2" show-link-on-mouseover id="formatting">Formatting</h2>
<p>I remember having heard on the <a href="https://changelog.com/jsparty/175">podcast with Patrick Ecker</a>
that ReScript comes with a formatting tool (just like golang, or many of the newer languages),
which prevents discussions about code layout, cool. Now it&#39;s time to apply it, the hello world 
code is growing, it needs some proper styling.</p>
<p>After <code>rescript -h</code> (remember, not <code>--help</code>!) I figured out it is <code>rescript format</code>.
Alright. I run <code>rescript format</code>, nothing happens. So I have to pass the filename explicitly.
Sad. Ok, <code>rescript format src/hello.res</code> works fine. It took me a while to read the <code>rescript format -h</code> 
help page properly to figure out that</p>
<pre><code class="undefinedshell-session"># rescript format -all</code></pre>
<p>is the script I want to call. Remember <code>-all</code> with <strong>one dash</strong> only (not <code>--all</code>!).
I <a href="https://codeberg.org/wolframkriesing/rescript-learning-commit-by-commit/commit/52da40b1ae9b2a9b0573bc1b95e17570b899842e">ran it on the code, committed</a>
and do not worry about coding style anymore (I thought).</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" show-link-on-mouseover id="first-type-annotations">First Type Annotations</h2>
<p>Yeah, a lot of tooling and stuff but no real types yet.
Here we go:</p>
<pre><code class="undefinedrescript">let helloWorld: string = &quot;Hello World&quot;</code></pre>
<p>I added the <code>:string</code> type annotation (<a href="https://codeberg.org/wolframkriesing/rescript-learning-commit-by-commit/commit/6a5c588c754d4f72543488f6c6cc9374ff26627a">see commit</a>),
it compiled and made no problems. I didn&#39;t expect it to either.</p>
<p>The type can go behind the value, enclosed in parens like so (<a href="https://codeberg.org/wolframkriesing/rescript-learning-commit-by-commit/commit/76f5cc660ae77b7e52b2bc631c8f2c0f3d5633d8">see commit</a>):</p>
<pre><code class="undefinedrescript">let helloWorld = (&quot;Hello World&quot;: string)</code></pre>
<p>Cool this feels like it might come in handy, eventually.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" show-link-on-mouseover id="type-alias">Type Alias</h2>
<p>Next I am trying a type alias. Makes it handy when I know this type might get more specialized later,
I had seen this often. Some value is currently of type string but is actually a &quot;license plate&quot; or &quot;city name&quot;,
so why not start out with a type alias like <code>type licensePlate = string</code>. I also think it can make code more
understandable, it&#39;s like a comment but eventually can be verified, once the licensePlate becomes a more explicit type than a string.
So I try:</p>
<pre><code class="undefinedrescript">type HelloWorldString = string
let helloWorld = (&quot;Hello World&quot;: HelloWorldString)</code></pre>
<p>I get a syntax error, a bit cryptic but I seem <a href="https://twitter.com/hoodie_de/status/1396857432605855749">not to be the only one</a> that feels this is 
not the best error message yet, but <a href="https://twitter.com/ryyppy/status/1397448731226562560">it&#39;s on the radar of the ReScript team</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="undefinedshell-session">Syntax error!
/app/src/hello.res:1:22-23

1 ‚îÇ type HelloWorldString = string
2 ‚îÇ 
3 ‚îÇ module Printer = {

Did you forget a `.` here?</code></pre>
<p>The answer to this error comes later in the docs, when learning about <a href="https://rescript-lang.org/docs/manual/latest/variant">variants</a>,
there the docs say &quot;a variant&#39;s constructors need to be capitalized&quot;. My assumption the compiler mixes this up
and gives some error message that I can not &quot;understand&quot; yet. I am leaving it at this for now.
It feels like something that eventually will dissolve when I read some docs or ReScript source code.
Good enough for now, that I learned types <strong>must start with lower case</strong>.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly this compiles and works just fine:</p>
<pre><code class="undefinedrescript">type HelloWorldString = string
let helloWorld = (&quot;Hello World&quot;: HelloWorldString)</code></pre>
<p>the <a href="https://codeberg.org/wolframkriesing/rescript-learning-commit-by-commit/commit/10a58ddb08cfa0b5d598cbb54ed8fe9c9f25d327">commit is here</a>.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" show-link-on-mouseover id="retrospective-1">Retrospective #1</h2>
<p>I want to wrap up the learning experience up to here a bit.</p>
<p>Actually I did not feel guided by the docs yet. What I did was going through the docs from top to 
bottom not knowing how much is left and if that path is a good path.<br>I am quite convinced that learning ReScript is a good thing, but I also remember that it was
the same thing with PureScript and I dropped it eventually when I got drowned in the 
functional rabbit hole way to deep. I am not sure if this can and will happen here too.
So I am bringing along a lot of optimism and hope that my time is well invested.</p>
<p>I am not sure everyone is so interested in finding this out by investing a lot of
time and eventually being disappointed. Maybe the docs could offer a short walk through ReScript
for those that have a shorter attention span.</p>
<p>Of course I was scrolling the docs a bit and I have seen that there is a lot more
to come for me to learn. But that is not surprising me and also just confirms that
I need a sustainable way of learning it.
I am always <a href="https://codeberg.org/wolframkriesing/rescript-learning-commit-by-commit">advancing the repo</a>
and some time later coming back here to write something down, which is a great recap for me.
And I am convinced it helps me to learn better.</p>
<p>My initial goal was to rewrite <a href="https://jskatas.org">jskatas.org</a> in ReScript, but
I realized quickly that I want to understand the language better before running with it.
That might just be how I roll. So be it. Find your way!</p>
<p>Along the way I was also looking for writing katas and learning ReScript that way, since that
is something I highly appreciate. But I didn&#39;t know how to do that in a language that
I don&#39;t know yet, I am quite happy extending the hello-world more and more.
I know the code becomes insanely stupid, just so I can use langauge features. 
But this serves the purpose well, at least for me.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" show-link-on-mouseover id="an-opinion-on-the-docs">An Opinion on the Docs</h2>
<p>The docs have quite an opinionated touch to them and, to be honest, they don&#39;t
read easy all the time. Sentences like &quot;ReScript is the language for folks who 
don&#39;t necessarily love JavaScript, but who still acknowledge its importance.&quot;
on the <a href="https://rescript-lang.org/docs/manual/latest/introduction">intro page of the docs</a>
don&#39;t make me feel as if I want this language for those reasons. I really do like
JavaScript, there is not just one language on this planet, but I also want to learn
ReScript but for different reasons.</p>
<p>The very opinionated &quot;thankfully&quot; sprinkled across the 
<a href="https://rescript-lang.org/docs/manual/latest/overview#comparison-to-js">&quot;Comparison to JS&quot;</a> page,
which I interpret (maybe wrongly) as &quot;what a stupid language feature&quot;,
might scare off some people. Not sure if this is intentional.
I don&#39;t like it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://rescript-lang.org/docs/manual/latest/introduction">intro page</a>,
has some glorification and subjective comparisons on it, like
&quot;TypeScript&#39;s type system is ...&quot;, &quot;Faster than JavaScript&quot; and &quot;Readable Output &amp; Great Interop&quot;.
I am not sure this belongs in a technical language documentation.
Maybe everything there is correct, but it feels kinda like &quot;ReScript is better&quot;,
it doesn&#39;t make me feel too comfortable reading it.</p>
<p>Others that also caught my attention (or am I just trying hard to find more examples?), are phrases like</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;other crazy patterns you&#39;ll soon find horrible, after getting used to ReScript&#39;s alternatives.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The more you overload the poor string type, the less the type system (or a teammate) can help you!&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>all of them on the <a href="https://rescript-lang.org/docs/manual/latest/primitive-types#tips--tricks">Primitive Types</a>
page in the docs. They are right, no doubt.
For me there is too much opinion in the docs. I want cold facts and decide for myself if anything I used
to do was horrible or not. Maybe I just don&#39;t agree and therefore drop learning ReScript, definitely not an intention
of the docs, right? Or am I too sensitive?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s tackle real useful data structures, some that don&#39;t (yet) exist in JavaScript land, go on to
