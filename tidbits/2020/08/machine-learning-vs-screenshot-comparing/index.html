I can create golden master tests now, that screenshot all the pages of my blog now, 
I refactor and should end up with the same screenshots. <br>
And then I can do the changes that I want to do, which will be simple after the refactor.<br>
I should!

<h2 is="more-h2" id="machine-learning-ftw">Machine Learning FTW?</h2>
<p>So I asked <a href="https://twitter.com/kamal4493">@Kamal</a>
a great colleague, who I learned a lot about Machine Learning from, among other really skilled
colleagues as HolidayCheck (<a href="https://twitter.com/ania_ch/status/1290368351139770371">sad day yesterday</a>).</p>
<p>So I proposed an idea to Kamal, I said, what about discovering bugs when rendering my website
using some simple machine learning (not sure if such a thing exists).
This was the rendering issue Holger pointed out yesterday:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../broken-landscape-rendering.gif" alt="Screwed up rendering in landscape mode" width="400" class="sizeup-onhover-image scale2 origin-left-center" />
<figcaption>Screwed up rendering in landscape mode</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What is wrong with the screenshot above? Well, I want it:</p>
<ul>
<li>to not wrap the navigation at the top</li>
<li>to have a  margin on the left of the text</li>
<li>to have both columns be equal, or in a portrait mode just be a single column.</li>
</ul>
<p>His first input was unexpected for me, since I just don&#39;t have much experience with ML (as if this is totally logical)
to use black and white  images and let some machine learning do the job.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="why-apply-machine-learning-here">Why Apply Machine Learning Here?</h2>
<p>Ok, let me take a  step back.</p>
<p>If all this  above was too  fast, let me explain my thoughts how I  got to the conclusion of why <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> 
can help here.
As I had  learned in <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone">AI for everyone</a> (that Kamal suggested to me)
<strong>every problem that we humans can  spot in one second or less can also be solved by an <abbr title="Artifiical Intelligence">AI</abbr> (or here ML)</strong>.</p>
<p>I was able to find the issue on my site in less than one second, and since I had seen amazing things
being done by machine learning I thought this might be a  good fit and something I could potentially tackle.
Besides it  being  a problem to  have  fun with and learn ML with, I also was postponing screenshot testing
for my  own site all the time, because for the last  10 years  I  have spent endless hours in screenshot
testing, adjusting thresholds, reviewing errors and flaky tests
and <a href="https://twitter.com/chaos_monster/status/1290629259816558593">so did others</a>.</p>
<p>Finally there  was  a  glimpse to fix this problem and hopefully solve it with a new approach.
I don&#39;t want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>continuously adjust master  screenshots</li>
<li>find visual  problems that are no real problems</li>
<li>compare images manually to figure out it was just a tiny diff in the font rendering</li>
<li>and there are many other issues with screenshot comparing imho.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the above I am convinced those kind of <abbr title="Visual Regression Tests">VRTs</abbr>
should not be blocking a deployment pipeline but be done after deploy, they are (still) slow.
But that is just a side note.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="learning-if-ml-fits">Learning if ML fits</h2>
<p>Kamal suggested <a href="https://keras.io/examples/vision/mnist_convnet/">keras</a> to &quot;it will get you started&quot; he says.
Also this for understanding 
<a href="https://keras.io/examples/vision/image_classification_from_scratch/">Image classification from scratch</a>.
What do all these functions mean? (see <a href="https://keras.io/examples/vision/mnist_convnet/#build-the-model">Build the model</a>)</p>
<pre><code class="undefinedpython">model = keras.Sequential(
[
keras.Input(shape=input_shape),
layers.Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation=&quot;relu&quot;),
layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
layers.Conv2D(64, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation=&quot;relu&quot;),
layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
layers.Flatten(),
layers.Dropout(0.5),
layers.Dense(num_classes, activation=&quot;softmax&quot;),
]
)
model.summary()</code></pre>
<p>I  am all lost. I thought it was  as simple as throwing some images somewhere and call <code>run()</code>.
I was naiv.
Kamal says &quot;maybe this helps <a href="https://keras.io/getting_started/intro_to_keras_for_engineers/">Introduction to Keras for Engineers</a>&quot;.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="the-plan-to--solve-my-problem">The Plan to  Solve my Problem</h2>
<p>Leaving all the ML internals aside. Let me try to explain what is my current plan on how to make use
of ML for solving this problem.</p>
<p>I have a plan now how to create images to train the model with, the images i would generate using my site:</p>
<ul>
<li>images always for different screen sizes, 1024x768, 1400x1900, etc.</li>
<li>images with the latest blog posts</li>
<li>images with older blog posts (1st...10th, 2nd...11th, 3rd..12th, ...) to have different looking sites</li>
<li>images for the different media-queries (portrait, landscape)</li>
<li>images for different font sizes (since <a href="/tidbits/2020/04/the-end-user-always-has-ultimate-control/">you can configure that in your browser</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course I need right and wrong images, I need to tag them accordingly first, so the model can learn.
Should it be 50/50? Ideally it should be, but doesnt have to be.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="whats-next">What&#39;s Next?</h2>
<p>Read <a href="/tidbits/2020/08/ml-vs-vrt-part-2-learning-keras/">part 2</a>
about what I tackled next and how I started to go through the keras tutorial to hope to learn
how to train my model.</p>
<p>I still have questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will it really be &quot;easy&quot; and possible to train a model to &quot;understand&quot; my screenshots?</li>
<li>Is this task not too big?</li>
<li>How do I know ML does the task well?</li>
<li>When will I see useful results?</li>
</ul>
