    <p>I renamed the series to &quot;ML for VRT&quot; instead of &quot;ML vs. VRT&quot;
since that is what I actually want to achieve (eventually), as you can read in 
<a href="/tidbits/2020/08/machine-learning-vs-screenshot-comparing/">Part 1 - Machine Learning vs. Screenshot Comparing?</a>.
Read on to figure out how I ended  up next  to learn about neural networks, because  I figured
out just applying some code examples learned from tutorials won&#39;t suffice my learning
and they  won&#39;t answer the questions I actually have to understand how to tune a 
neural network to do what I image it to do, detecting screenshots for visual regression testing.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="use-keras-an-ml-library-for-the-first-time">Use Keras, an ML Library, for the First Time</h2>
<p>As described in <a href="/tidbits/2020/08/ml-vs-vrt-part-2-learning-keras/">part 2</a>
I started to learn Keras in order to  write a first machine learning algorithm myself.</p>
<p>If you want to  dive  right in, find <a href="https://codeberg.org/wolframkriesing/learning-ml">this repo &quot;learning-ml&quot;</a>
where I built a docker container which runs a <a href="https://jupyter.org/">jupyter</a>
notebook and where I played around with, first the example from a course
and second exploring a simple task to use ML on. But let&#39;s go step by step.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="the-example-from-the-keras-tutorial">The Example From the Keras Tutorial</h2>
<p>As described in  the earlier parts I followed Kamal&#39;s suggestions to learn using ML
by reading <a href="https://keras.io/getting_started/intro_to_keras_for_engineers/">Introduction to Keras for Engineers</a>
which turned out to raise many more questions than answers.
My  way of learning was to  read the tutorial and figure out if I can understand what is being 
done. I failed.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="why-did-i-fail-learning-from-keras-for-engineers">Why did I fail Learning from &quot;Keras for Engineers&quot;</h2>
<p>First,  one should understand what is my background.
I am a normal software developer, I  have done a lot of low-level (without web),
in 1999 I jumped into the web, I did  a  lot of PHP, Python, etc. and for the last 
20  years I  do  mostly JavaScript extensively. I love to read the specs of technologies
I use (if available) and I like to learn and understand the history and reasons
why a certain technology was developed and is used for. And I know the applications
technologies are used for change over time.</p>
<p>Back to learning from &quot;Keras for Engineers&quot;.
I thought I read through the code on the page, read the explanations and I will be set
to go and make use of machine learning. Actually, my initial expectation was even simpler,
I thought I download some library  and throw right and wrong screenshots in some 
directories and tell  the code to learn and then I have trained a model to detect
right and wrong screenshots. It turned out to not be that easy.</p>
<p>You might succeed with that simple approach by going another path, but I am the
kind of person, I like to understand what is happening under the hood. 
I started my career learning low-level languages like C and Assembler, I knew
(more or less) well what was going on under the hood.
So I expect the same here. I want to understand how does a ML code come up
with the result that it comes up with.</p>
<p>Well, I already learned over the last years at HolidayCheck from my colleagues
that worked with ML, that &quot;understanding&quot; and maybe even verifying why an ML model
comes up with a certain result is not really how it works.
Anyways, I am  a bit stubborn :).</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="switch-to-a-tensorflow-course-via-video">Switch to a TensorFlow Course via Video</h2>
<p>I searched around and got stuck with a freeCodeCamp.org video
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFJeN9V1ZsI">Keras with TensorFlow Course - Python Deep Learning and Neural Networks for Beginners Tutorial</a>.
I did work through the first hour, because already learned in the first ten minutes
to understand terminology which had  raised question  marks in the previously mentioned
Keras tutorial. So I followed along.</p>
<p>I think I  kinda got the hang of it. I learned to at least understand how the parts
are connected, not that I really understand all the terms used yet, but the course gave me
a good feeling of where things belong.
So I did the first example from scratch, writing all the code by hand by  fast forwarding the
video for a second time to the places where the code was shown. Even though I did  not
totally understand  the reason for building the  first model I got it to  run.
See <a href="https://codeberg.org/wolframkriesing/learning-ml">the repo</a> and 
<a href="https://codeberg.org/wolframkriesing/learning-ml/src/branch/main/1-patients-example1.py">the source code online of the first &quot;patients example&quot;</a>.
You can run it either in a jupyter notebook,  which is handy, but not how I prefer it to do.
Or you can run it on the command line after cloning the repo like so <code>./run.sh python 1-patients-example1.py</code>.
See  the <a href="https://codeberg.org/wolframkriesing/learning-ml/src/branch/main/README.md">README</a> for more detailed instructions.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="my-own-first-model-training">My Own First Model Training</h2>
<p>The  actual fun part comes now. I want to train a model that I came up with, where I can also
judge the predictions.</p>
<p>So I needed a problem, a simple problem to solve first.
While I first thought I was in  a dead end when the input is just simple numbers,
I quickly  realized I can come up with many examples that can be simple things for an AI to learn.
I thought <strong>why not train an AI to learn to find even and odd numbers</strong>?
Let me take away, the result first. I failed. I could not make the model learn that on my first try.
But knowing and trying to find out why is a great learning too.</p>

<ul>
<li>I started with <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone/">https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone/</a></li>
<li>Thomas suggested to learn with <a href="https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=1">https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=1</a>
the code that will be used <a href="https://github.com/fastai/course-v3/blob/master/nbs/dl1/lesson1-pets.ipynb">https://github.com/fastai/course-v3/blob/master/nbs/dl1/lesson1-pets.ipynb</a></li>

<li>Thomas said even/odd can be done, but I need to learn how, I have no clue</li>
