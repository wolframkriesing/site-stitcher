    <p>I just came across an article again, that had &quot;(sic!)&quot; in it, and I finally looked up
what it means. I also see it in german text. So it&#39;s time to look  it up and learn what
it means and how to use it when appropriate.</p>
<p>Fortunately there is 
<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/sic-meaning-usage-editorial-citation">an explanation in the Merriam-Webster</a> 
where it is kinda nicely summarized.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is denoted by sic is that the word or phrase that precedes it occurs in the original 
passage being quoted or name being used and was not introduced by the writer doing the quoting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand. At least for a second. But how do I know which part is the cited part?
So I continue reading  to understand  it better. But I get a bit confused.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes the quoted text contains an error of grammar or spelling, but other times it might 
not contain an error at all, but some kind of language or phrasing that might be unexpected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why does it mention errors? Is that really so important when citing?</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="sic-is-finger-pointing">&quot;Sic&quot; is Finger-pointing?</h2>
<p>Reading a bit further in the  article, that turns out to  be verry  informative,  but also less
explicit about when and how to use &quot;sic&quot;, a sentence sticks out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a host of etiquette issues that surround sic. Since it often follows misspellings 
or nontraditional language use, some commentators see it as a means of needlessly making a 
value judgment on someone else’s language habits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, that sounds &quot;sic&quot; is kind of a blaming tool or finger pointing technique. Actually, that&#39;s also
where I found it today in a German political tweet. Am I getting the hang of it?
A bit later the article confirms my feeling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The New Yorker’s Louis Menand describes sic as a “damning interpolation, combining ordinary, 
garden-variety contempt with pedantic condescension.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had to look up what &quot;pedantic condescension&quot; means, but yeah this sounds like a blaming tool.
Since I don&#39;t feel very much like blaming, at least I try  not to, I would stick to  this:</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="you-can-also-paraphrase">You can Also Paraphrase</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes it may be better to paraphrase the text and avoid what seems like haughty comment 
on another writer’s choices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is always some doubt left one may misunderstands and wrong-uses other people&#39;s words.
Especially nowadays in times of short messages, short attention spans and headline skimming.</p>
<p>The  last paragraph  ends the article like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Additionally, it’s regarded as bad form to use sic repeatedly when the same error or weird spelling occurs in a document.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is more to  that last paragraph but without having read the entire article, it does not make
so much sense. Finally, I can just recommend to read the article 
<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/sic-meaning-usage-editorial-citation">Showing Off Your [Sic] Moves</a>,
and it&#39;s not just for pointing out errors (sic).</p>
