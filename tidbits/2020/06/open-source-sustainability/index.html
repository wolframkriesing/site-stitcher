    <p>The title does not really enclose all the topics and cover the full value of this talk.
Actually it is not explicit enough, because sustainability is a word that is being used 
in too many contexts and means too much.
I would maybe rephrase the title to 
&quot;The Real Cost and Value of Open Source and Why and How Your Company can Participate and Give Back&quot;.
A bit clunky, but it tells the story I believe.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/tobie">@Tobie Langel</a> starts by mentioning ways how open source gets funded
nowadays. Though he limits it to the money-funding parts, I believe the employed as full-time
open source dev, funding through free license of products, etc. is not included.</p>
<p>Later he adds up the salary of all developers and compares it to the open source funding that
<a href="https://opencollective.com/">open collective</a> has given out in 2018. I am not sure I can fully
follow the comparison, since one is salaries and the other is funding for open source projects, 
maybe I just didn&#39;t get why they are comparable. But I think it very well shows the dimensions
of value created in the open source space, because if all open source work would be payed 
I believe the sum of all salaries would be beyond this trillion. But that&#39;s just my guesstimate.</p>
<p>He goes on with taking apart the limitation that funding open source just with money has.
Pretty nice drill down on the problem.
His final conclusion is a bit richer, but let me say this: It is clear that there are not 
many companies that understand the real value of open source yet.</p>
<p>@tobie The next talk could be about how to establish a sustainable software cycle in companies, that
do not just make use of open source.</p>
<p>Watch it, I can highly recommend it.</p>

<p>... I just remember is
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTKvLSnFL6I">Why I forked my own project and my own company ownCloud to Nextcloud</a>
by Frank Karlitschek, Nextcloud Founder. He talks about how and why he re-tried his company
and is convinced that doing full and real open source is the better approach.</p>
