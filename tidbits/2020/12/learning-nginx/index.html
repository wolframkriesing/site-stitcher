    <p>Until today I was just a copy+paster of nginx configs. I thought I had my share back when I learned and undestood
apache very well, so why learn another one. But my nextcloud setup and letsencrypt that comes with it has an nginx
&quot;bundled&quot;, so I would like to understand things a bit better. So I started reading the docs and will take my notes here.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="open-source-or-not">Open Source Or Not?</h2>
<p>I been surfing and reading on nginx.com which didn&#39;t feel very open sourcy and always mentioned &quot;NGINX Plus&quot;,
where I felt I have to go and buy it, which was the intention, I guess. But I did find 
<a href="https://nginx.org/">nginx.org</a> and reading the <a href="https://nginx.org/en/">about nginx</a>
I also got the confirmation for my feelings, there is the open source universe and the commercial universe
for nginx. Very cool, I love it when open source can be made sustainable by having those that can/want/should
do pay for the software. Sounds like another open source based business at work, awesome!</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="notes-on-server-server_name-and-location">Notes on <code>server</code>, <code>server_name</code> and <code>location</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>The first server block (as the docs name it), looking like this <code>server {</code>, is <strong>the default server</strong>, used when none below matches</li>
<li><strong>Search Priorities</strong> is always 1) exact name 2) wildcards 3) regular expressions
this seems to be that case for <a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/server_names.html">server_name</a> and location
which I only found explained very much <a href="https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/web-server/#nginx-location-priority">in detail on nginx.com</a>  </li>
<li><strong>Location search priorities</strong> are also explained <a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/request_processing.html#simple_php_site_configuration">using examples here</a></li>
<li>&quot;locations of all types test only a URI part of request line without arguments&quot; which means query params can NOT
be used for filtering for a location, sounds reasonable since that might end in hell</li>
<li><code>location / {</code> matches any request and it will be used as a last resort</li>
<li>regular expressions are PCRE, Perl regular expressions, <a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/server_names.html#regex_names">details for usage in nginx are here</a></li>
<li>The strange <code>server_name _</code> as I found in my nextcloud nginx, <a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/server_names.html#miscellaneous_names">is explained here too</a><blockquote>
<p>There is nothing special about this name, it is just one of a myriad of invalid domain names which never intersect with any real name. Other invalid names like “--” and “!@#” may equally be used. </p>
</blockquote>
