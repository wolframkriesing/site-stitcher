    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/react-native-picker/picker">React Native picker</a> is a module I had a couple of 
<a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/7817#issuecomment-264837382">touchpoints</a>
with. Even before it had moved repositories. Now it moved again.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="some-history">Some History</h2>
<p>Back <strong>in 2016</strong> the picker was shipped with <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native">React Native</a>.</p>
<p>When I started working with React Native again in September <strong>2020</strong> it had moved out of React Native into 
community repo, judging by the repo name: github.com/react-native-community/picker.</p>
<p>Looking at the repo <strong>today</strong> (while still trying to learn how to style the component on android)
I learned that the repo <a href="https://github.com/react-native-picker/picker/pull/155">had moved again</a>,
this time to <a href="https://github.com/react-native-picker/picker">github.com/react-native-picker/picker</a>.</p>
<p>Reading the commit linked above I learned that the &quot;react-native-community&quot; org seems not to host repos anymore,
which makes sense I think, otherwise everyone would want to be there which makes it kinda like another internet :).
I am just not sure if this means that the component will be maintained more intensively than it was the case in the last years.
Actually it sounds like a good open source project to help with, I felt the pain for a long time and if you browse the issues
I feel that most of them are about styling the picker (on Android).
Let&#39;s see if I get my android things solved and lets see then.</p>
