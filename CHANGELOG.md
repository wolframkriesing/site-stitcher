# Ideas
- [ ] 301 /tidbits/ to /tidbit/ all URLs are singular
- [ ] BUG H1s have no id, since I manually render them :(
- [ ] see `npm run build:images:gif` it only builds for tidbits, unify and simplify building assets for all dirs
- [ ] webcomponent to show last changes to the content, load it from gh, just pass it a url like so
      <pico-changelog source="https://github.com/wolframkriesing/site-stitcher/content/tidbits.md" />
- [ ] provide data for rich snippets https://search.google.com/test/rich-results 
- [ ] the tidbits are not SEO indexed
- [ ] video links could have a video-icon behind it, would be cool
- [ ] show embedded code that "commit" link links to, if possible
      sounds like a nice web component
- [ ] generate an index, see "Build, Measure, Speed, Repeat" post, that index could be auto generated
      auto-create a <ol id=toc> in a post with the table of contents, see also SEO hints about it
- [ ] allow linking headline, esp useful on long article more-html ftw ;)
- [ ] when selected some text open a "tweet this" or "share this" button
- [ ] use a different font, to also be able to outline and distinguish source code better
- [ ] learn and apply a11y properly
- [ ] show "load more" or pagination on first page
- [ ] add all my 
  - [ ] conference talks
  - [ ] conference visits
  - [ ] open source projects
  - [ ] events I ran (jscc, jscr, jslang, ...)
  - [ ] the jobs i had  
- [ ] make useful (and talk about)
  - [ ] tests-stitcher
  - [ ] to-do-list-checker (todo-stitcher)
  - [ ] kavun (pico-test)
- [ ] generate dates (started, published, last changed) from commits
- [ ] add og meta tags (https://ogp.me/)
- [ ] lint/verify the syntax of a blog post
  - [ ] can have meta tags at the top only
  - [ ] the syntax of the metadata is defined, see BlogPostMetadata type 
  - [ ] must start with headline, has an abstract next
  - [ ] even dates with time MUST end in "... CET" and be formatted like so "2000-01-01 10:00 CET"
  - [ ] end metadata line with two spaces
  - [ ] has youtube/vimeoId and must have tag #video 
- [ ] a stats page which sums all the mini-stats from above and shows it for ALL pages of this site
- [ ] provide thumbnailUrl (see schema) for a post
- [ ] handle or remove `related_tweets:` which some posts still have
- [ ] indieweb auth of my page
- [ ] what about URL incompatible chars in a markdownFilename?
- [ ] rename `BlogPost#markdownFilename` to `sourceFile`?
- [ ] should the new-post tests really be soo specific and detailled? it tests underlying function, currently ...
- [ ] crawl all pages put them in a DB (or alike) and make sure all exist in the new setup
