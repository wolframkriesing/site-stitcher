  - [ ] the syntax of the metadata is defined, see BlogPostMetadata type 
  - [ ] must start with headline, has an abstract next
  - [ ] even dates with time MUST end in "... CET" and be formatted like so "2000-01-01 10:00 CET"
  - [ ] end metadata line with two spaces 
- [ ] show mini stats at the bottom of every page (maybe later as a chart over time)

  - [ ] download size of the page
  - [ ] amount of HTML, CSS, JS on the page
  - [ ] 3rd party URLs loaded on the page

- [ ] handle or remove `related_tweets:` which some posts still have
- [ ] indieweb auth of my page

- [ ] what about URL incompatible chars in a markdownFilename?

# v1 - my website
- [x] make it run using docker
- [x] use schema.org types from the beginning, no need to invent any structure, reuse and make discoverable content easy, e.g. https://schema.org/BlogPosting
- [x] copy all picostitch posts here
- [x] if no 1st paragraph show nothing as abstract 
      see `20-bookmark-collect-may-2015.md` and files where abstract and headline is the same
- [x] add plausible
- [ ] build the post page
  - [x] provide the old URLs as used on picostitch now
  - [ ] 301 from the old url to the new one
        maybe can give a 301 list to the server, so we wont need a page for each ... lets see what/if hetzner can do it
  - [x] render [x][y] links properly, seems not to work - newline before was missing
- [x] provide meta data
  - [x] use multimarkdown style, just key-value pairs at the top
  - [x] update all posts to use it
  - [x] add the metadata to BlogPost
  - [x] render the metadata if needed (e.g. on the post page)
- [x] make it deploy on GH
- [ ] move domain to GH
- [ ] add footer and imprint
- [ ] generate index page from md files
  - [ ] make it work on mobile
  - [x] dont fail on invalid files in blog post dirs
  - [x] sort newest to top
  - [x] render the markdown of the abstract properly into HTML
  - [x] show the date like this "24 Jan, 2002"
  - [ ] allow dirs not only md files 04-blog-post/index.md
        see: `2015/05/11-alan-kay-on-messaging`        
- [ ] add licensing on the page!
- [x] `npm run new-post` script to create dir and file
  - [x] create a BlogPost instance
  - [x] write markdown file to disk
  - [x] implement date fn
- [ ] update BlogPost types and Metadata
- [ ] should the new-post tests really be soo specific and detailled? it tests underlying function, currently ...
- [ ] instead of BlogPost.preload() extract it to BlogPostSourceFile.*()
- [ ] rename `markdownFilename` to `sourceFile`
