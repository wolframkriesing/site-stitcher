        <p>
          I have been through a couple projects to build my blog. None survived, so I
          just build, just what I need, with just enough code to get it done.

        <h2>JSCodeRetreat #13, Tetris again</h2>
        <p>
          It was the second time that we did Tetris as our task for the JSCodeRetreat and I have to say,
          that the participants' comment made me realize that we are on the right track.
          Though not all comments were purely in favor of Tetris, I think Tetris is the better
          task for a (JS) CodeRetreat.
