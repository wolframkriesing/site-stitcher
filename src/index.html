      <p>
        I have been through a couple projects to build my blog. None survived, so I
        just build, just what I need, with just enough code to get it done.

      <h2><a href="">JSCodeRetreat #13, Tetris again</a></h2>
      <p>
        It was the second time that we did Tetris as our task for the JSCodeRetreat and I have to say,
        that the participants' comment made me realize that we are on the right track.
        Though not all comments were purely in favor of Tetris, I think Tetris is the better
        task for a (JS) CodeRetreat.
