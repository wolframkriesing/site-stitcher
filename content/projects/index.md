# Projects üö¥üèª
See projects that I work on, mostly in my spare time.
I started and run various events and I also write open source code.

## Events
The following events are either started, co-organized and/or run by me.

### Monthly JavaScript the Language Meetup
The [meetup JavaScript the Language](https://www.meetup.com/JavaScript-The-Language)
is an evening event that I run almost every month, 
[since October 2015](https://www.meetup.com/JavaScript-The-Language/events/mrkzklytpbgc/).
It is a no-presentations-meetup, **focusing on JavaScript the language, only**. 
https://gitlab.com/wolframkriesing/jslang-meetups contains all tests that we 
write every evening we meet. No frameworks, libraries or alike, just JavaScript, just the language.
Every meetup is hands on and deep dive into the language. Learn, share, practice and teach.

### JSCraftCamp
We started [the JSCraftCamp](http://jscraftcamp.org/) in 2016. It takes place once a year, in summer.
It is a two days BarCamp/Unconference with the focus on
JavaScript and all topics around it. The event is completely sponsored and free of charge.
We organize it in our spare time, everything, including the orga is on [github](https://github.com/jscraftcamp/website).  

### JSCodeRetreat
The [JS CodeRetreat](http://jscoderetreat.com) is a full day TDD focused, pair- or mob-programming
event, where everyone is programming five times 45min exchanging the learnings regularly.
The first one took place in [February 2014](http://jscoderetreat.com/1/).
 
A CodeRetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of 
software development and design. This FREE event gives the opportunity to practice TDD, 
Clean Code and Refactoring for a whole day. This isn‚Äôt a conference! Rules are totally different, 
attendees take actively part in the coding experience: act a lot, listen very little.



## Open Source Code
I love programming and love to put stuff online as mostly as open source.

### jskatas.org
On [jskatas.org](https://jskatas.org/) you can find about 100 katas for learning the language JavaScript.
Every kata consists of failing tests that shall be fixed one after another.

I learned ES6 by writing it and failing. Out of this the es6katas evolved. And since, 
this allowed me to always again go back and (re-)learn ES6 I wrote katas for ES8, later ES1 
(I always got the sort() function wrong). At some point I started to learn a very expressive assertion 
library hamjest by writing katas for it, and so this page came about.
Enjoy and I hope you have fun learning with it. 

### tddbin.com
I built [tddbin.com](https://tddbin.com/) for the first [JSCodeRetreat](#jscoderetreat)
to have a no-install environment for writing and running JavaScript tests.

### pico-tester
[Pico Tester](https://github.com/wolframkriesing/pico-tester) 
is a small and fast spec runner for Javascript. Mocha, Jest, etc. bring too much 
burden along, either from history or features. This library is a reset. Using the least needed 
for a test runner. Also in terms of dependencies pico-tester tries to use the least needed.


### todo-stitcher
The [todo-stitcher](https://github.com/wolframkriesing/todo-stitcher) is a project that
checks a list of to-do items to determine if the project is ready for release. Sounds weird? 
Read [the details](https://github.com/wolframkriesing/todo-stitcher#releasing) 
of what I mean by that and how this changed the way I develop.

### test-stitcher
I describe [test-stitcher](https://github.com/wolframkriesing/test-stitcher) 
alike this: Stitch all tests together, to see the big picture.

Get insights on tests. Get a tree structure of all tests, their test descriptions and 
some stats about each test and each test suite (or group of tests).
This project lets you read (and analyze) the test descriptions, to understand what the code does.
Test descriptions are the human-readable describing a test, see examples below.

### More HTML components
The [More HTML components](https://github.com/more-html/components) project 
provides several web components that just enhance HTML. Some are provided as pure 
web components ala `<more-somecomponent>` and others can be used via customized built-in elements 
(CBEs read [more on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements)), 
such as `<h1 is=more-h1>` which enhances an H1 with certain functionality. 
See [the examples](https://more-html.github.io/components/examples/) 
for some more in depth explanation and examples.

### site-stitcher
I describe [site-stitcher](https://github.com/wolframkriesing/site-stitcher) like this:
> Others would call it static site generator. But tbh, I don't know where it goes. 
> Currently this tool serves for creating my website https://picostitch.com
