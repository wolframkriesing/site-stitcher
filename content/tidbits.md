# Tidbits

Find tiny pieces of code, commands, snippets, stuff that I find interesting, useful
or where I know that I will search for it again but it's not worth writing an
entire blog post about. Just make it findable. My private stackoverflow, without
the wrong code that one could copy ;).

## Capitalization Rules for Headlines

I didn't know that for English ["sources disagree on the details of capitalizing prepositions"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalization#Titles). I read so often "capitalize all words of four letters or more". What an arbitrary rule is that? Ok, I will try to follow it.\
There are a couple (SEO) sites that capitalize your headline, you'll find them when you need 'em.

## Free Disk Space Used by Docker

Use `docker system df` to look at the disk space used by docker, to see if it is worth it, or to be better informed.
I got this output:
```
> docker system df
TYPE                TOTAL               ACTIVE              SIZE                RECLAIMABLE
Images              125                 12                  15.27GB             15.03GB (98%)
Containers          53                  0                   12.6GB              12.6GB (100%)
Local Volumes       24                  9                   344.2MB             295.4MB (85%)
Build Cache         169                 0                   5.8GB               5.8GB
```

Now that you know, you can free the memory with:
```
> docker system prune
WARNING! This will remove:
  - all stopped containers
  - all networks not used by at least one container
  - all dangling images
  - all dangling build cache
