# Tidbits

Here are the things I would tweet but I see too valuable to just give away to twitter, so I store them
here as tidbits. 
Find tiny pieces of code, commands, snippets, stuff that I find interesting, useful
or where I know that I will search for it again but it's not worth writing an
entire blog post about. Just make it findable. My private stackoverflow, without
the wrong code that one could copy ;).

## Find and Execute Command with Found Files

tag: linux

You need to 
1. Find files and
2. Execute a command with each found file

This is how it works:\
`find . -name '*.jpg' -exec cp '{}' ../_output'{}' \;`

The command finds all `*.jpg`s via `find . -name '*.jpg'`.
Next with `-exec cp` it is told to execute the command `cp` for every file found.
The `{}` is the placeholder for the filename that find returns.
Play around with each part of the command to see the output.
Maybe for learning start with `find . -name '*.jpg' -exec echo "file1: {}" \;`.
You will also find out how important the `\;` at the end is!

## Very Fast Docker Image Build - Without Context

tag: docker

I use docker images to provide the environment for development. My nodejs
is installed only inside the docker image. That means I always map my working directory
into the container. This means I don't need to send no build context to the docker deamon.

Before my **slow docker build** started like this:\
`Sending build context to Docker daemon  ` **` 88.67MB`** VERY SLOW\
that happens when you use\
`docker build -t ${IMAGE_NAME} -f Dockerfile .` and it takes forever.

I got the **fast docker build** after I discovered in the docker docs, that one can also not send the context,
now the context is tiny:\
`Sending build context to Docker daemon  ` **` 2.048kB`** VERY FAST.\
Build your image like this:\
`docker build -t ${IMAGE_NAME} - < Dockerfile`\
Remember: you get no context in the container, so either you don't need it
or you map in volumes, or you know ...

## `$` and `$$` - Shortcut for `document.querySelector[All]()`

tag: devtools  

I still often type `document.querySelector()` or `document.querySelectorAll()`
even though even before this was available in the browser the developer consoles, FireBugs or whatever
they were called had a shorter version available `$` and `$$`. Yep, it works almost exactly the
same, just that one returns a `NodeList` the other an array. Just try it.
It works in all browsers as far as I know, I tried Firefox, Safari, Chrome and Edge.
See the image below for how it works in Firefox.

<figure>
    <img src="./dollar-and-dollardollar.gif" alt="no real output" width=300 class="sizeup-onhover-image scale4 origin-left-center" />
    <figcaption>$ and $$ vs document.querySelector[All]()</figcaption>

## Than vs. Then

tag: english  

I always struggled with it. Actually I looked it up a couple days ago and until today I was under
the assumption "than" was for time and ordering, I had been confused and wrong.

> **Then** is for time or ordering  
> **Than** is for comparing

and stuff to learn.

## Dive into HTML5 - Mark Pilgrim (and community)

tag: html  

I read the real book a long time ago, but I just moved this blog to use
proper `<aside>`, `<article>` and alikes today, I had forgotten a lot.
But I remember it being the best HTML(5) in depth I ever saw.
https://diveinto.html5doctor.com/ a must read!

## HTML Validators

tag: html  

* [validator.nu](https://validator.nu/) seems to be the same used at [validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org/).
  Describes itself as ["Validator.nu is validation 2.0"](https://about.validator.nu/).
* [Structured Data Linter, linter.structured-data.org](http://linter.structured-data.org/)
  "The Linter understands the microdata, JSON-LD and RDFa formats according to their latest specifications."
  [they say](http://linter.structured-data.org/about/)
* [yandex's Structured data validator](https://yandex.com/support/webmaster/yandex-indexing/validator.html)
  "it also checks if the markup meets the requirements of Yandex's services".
* [Bing Markup Validator](https://www.bing.com/toolbox/markup-validator) requires a sign-in and than it
  "shows the markup weâ€™ve discovered, including HTML Microdata, Microformats, RDFa, Schema.org, and OpenGraph".    
* [Google's structured data testing tool](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool)
  verifies the schema.org (structured data) validity, I assume they validate as it is relevant for their search engine.    

## &lt;details&gt; HTML element

tag: html  

Click below to see the code which creates this kinda dropdown, it is the `<details>` element.
<details>
    <summary>A &lt;details&gt; code example (click here)</summary>
    <pre>
        &lt;details&gt;
            &lt;summary&gt;A &amp;lt;details&amp;gt; code example (click here)&lt;/summary&gt;
            ... too much recursion ... ;)
        &lt;/details&gt;
    </pre>        
</details>

The `<details>` element "creates a disclosure widget in which information is visible only when the widget is 
toggled into an "open" state" [MDN says](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details).

## Semantic HTML: Usage of Headings, Sections

tag: html  

Wondering how to layout and use `<section>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc. I came across
the first place one should read on MDN
[Using HTML sections and outlines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML_sections_and_outlines)
also very insightful and more specific is this on the W3C wiki
[HTML/Usage/Headings/Missing](https://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Usage/Headings/Missing).
If you have 27 minutes to learn how to use all those semantic tags watch Brian Haferkamp's 
[Semantic Elements and Structure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dQ2Big9ueg) a very well explained video.

## OKRs are Works in Progress

I read it multiple times already in [Measure What Matters](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39286958-measure-what-matters)
by John Doerr, that OKRs are flexible. I normally underline those things, but now I have to note it somewhere where I can find it again without physically needing the book. On page 54 he writes

> Remember that an OKR can be modified or even scrapped at any point in its cycle. Sometimes the "right" key results 
> surface weeks or months after a goal is put into play.

The TL;DR for me is the sentence after it

> OKRs are inherently works in progress, not commandments chiseled in stone.

**Learning and mastering OKRs takes time and practice.** On page 68 Brett Kopf of Remind says:

> OKRs are basically simple, but you don't master the process off the bat. Early on, we'd be off by 
> miles in our company-level objectives, mostly on the way-too-ambitious side.

On page 75 David from Nuna confirms that:

> You're not going to get the system just right the first time around. It's not going to be perfect
> the second or the third  time, either. But don't get discouraged. Persevere. You need to adapt it to make it your own.

## Capitalization Rules for Headlines

tag: english  

I didn't know that for English ["sources disagree on the details of capitalizing prepositions"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalization#Titles). I read so often "capitalize all words of four letters or more". What an arbitrary rule is that? Ok, I will try to follow this and capitalizing all "major words", they call them.\
There are a couple (SEO) sites that capitalize your headline  correctly, you'll find them when you need 'em.

## Free Disk Space Used by Docker

tag: docker  

TL;DR use any/all of `docker system prune`, `docker container prune`, `docker image prune`,  `docker volume prune` or `docker network prune` to free the according space.

Use `docker system df` to look at the disk space used by docker, to see if it is worth it, or to be better informed.
I got this output:
```
> docker system df
TYPE                TOTAL               ACTIVE              SIZE                RECLAIMABLE
Images              125                 12                  15.27GB             15.03GB (98%)
Containers          53                  0                   12.6GB              12.6GB (100%)
Local Volumes       24                  9                   344.2MB             295.4MB (85%)
Build Cache         169                 0                   5.8GB               5.8GB
```

Now that you know, you can free the memory with:
```
> docker system prune
WARNING! This will remove:
  - all stopped containers
  - all networks not used by at least one container
  - all dangling images
  - all dangling build cache

Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
Deleted Containers:
0b6aafd9ce1d346bec7470f6042b6e1b30516973e096ef1954ccd823f9bb846a
...
```

After that  no containers to be removed anymore, proof:
```
> docker container prune
WARNING! This will remove all stopped containers.
Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
Total reclaimed space: 0B
```

Run `docker image prune --all` to gain a lot of disk space with the trade off of removing all your images, which will be downloaded when needed again.
