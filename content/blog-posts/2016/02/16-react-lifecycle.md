# React LifeCycle

Actually we are currently discussing and evaluating to use react or alike
and this ![react lifecycle](http://imgh.us/react-lifecycle.svg) comes in perfectly and somehow
also makes the point stronger that a well documented, cared and widely used
project is a good thing to be using.
Decided!
