[This sticks out, so far :)][law-of-demeter-post]
Avdi Grimm's article about the law of demeter, reading it including all commetsn until the end
will take a bit of time but is exactly what explains a lot of things that
imho we do wrong in lots of software we write, I am working on improving myself around it.
For the completeness here is the paper initially laying out the [law of demeter][law-demeter-paper].
