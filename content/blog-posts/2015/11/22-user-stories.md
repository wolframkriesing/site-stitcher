# User stories

In the last days I had to learn a lot about how to use, write and understand
user stories. [This talk][userstories-talk] by Mike Cohn is a pretty good 
kick start and summary for the hows and whys.

I also use [his site][userstories-site] a lot. And the 
[agile alliance site][userstories-agilealliance]
has some nice collection of infos too.
