# GraphQL

I just read a [post about GraphQL][graphql-post], and because the headline and all the article
contains so much excitment and passion for the topic I read it until the end.

> With a GraphQL schema in place, this becomes a nonissue. A GraphQL API can function perfectly well

and the closing and surely a tiny bit biased opinion of the article's author

> Basically, GraphQL is the future of the internet. For the next few years anyway. REST was great,

> GraphQL layer for our own sanities sake. But, IMHO GraphQL is the future.

There is even [a spec][graphql-spec].
