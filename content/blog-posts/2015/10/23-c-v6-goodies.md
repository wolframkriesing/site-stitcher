# C# v6 goodies

C# has a way better expression for what we write in JavaScript like so 
`obj.method && obj.method()` and in C# you can do `obj?.method()`
which is pretty slick I think.
See [this video (in german)][c# goodies exists operator] for a short explaination.

nameof - is another nice C# feature, which allows us to get the name of an argument
as explained [here (in german)][c# goodies nameof].
