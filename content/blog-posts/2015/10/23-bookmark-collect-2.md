# Bookmark collect #2, October 2015

It's time to clean up all my open browser tabs again, not because I want to collect things
just because my browser gets too slow and as usual (except with code - I learned that) 
I have to collect things.

After the great architecture talk by Uncle Bob, I had to look at [the FitNesse source code], 
started off by Uncle Bob and friends. To be honest, I was looking for the most perfect code
that is out there ... mmmh, seems reality kicked in too :) [still have to learn that this is life].

[JB Rainsberger] is coming to [XP Days] ... mmmh, I think I should go there, just don't have a ticket yet.

A very entertaining but loooong [Twit show (#528)] about all things web including ad blocking and so on.

At JSConf.eu [greenkeeper] was released, so I looked up how I would approach keeping my deps up to date
without it (just thinking I don't need yet another tool) - the answer is on stackoverflow, as usual.

[Classes in ECMAScript 6 (final semantics)](http://www.2ality.com/2015/02/es6-classes-final.html)

the single-threaded event loop while writing expressive, simple code in a direct, top-down style.
