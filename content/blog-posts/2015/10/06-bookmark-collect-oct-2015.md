## Invent the future - Reginald Braithwaite

> Optimizing for readability, sometimes the implementation is really terrible.
> Behind the scenes those testing frameworks and so on are really ugly. And they 
> are leaky abstractions.

You have to work with them in the way they were thought of to be used.

> You have to understand what the exact model is that makes it so easy to read.

> Language features are kind of a technical debt. They give you something today, but down the
> road you will be paying for them.
