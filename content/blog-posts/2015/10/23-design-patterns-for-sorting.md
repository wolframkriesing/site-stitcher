# Design Patterns for Sorting - a paper

In the paper ["Design Patterns for Sorting"][design-patterns-for-sorting], 
the internals of how to implement a decoupled version of a 
sorting algorithm is described. It also shows that the complexity of something
like a quicksort is not necessarily high, which should remove the fear of just
trying out to implement it.\
Maybe that's a good idea for a kata, that might go into the [katas repo].
