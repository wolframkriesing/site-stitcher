# gr8craft - Walking Skeleton

Unfortunately I missed Franziska's session at SoCraTes 2015 on this topic,
but fortunately she [wrote about it][gr8craft 1], make sure to also read through
[her commits][gr8craft 2] backwards, of course :). Very nice and readable!
[An article "Kickstart your next project with a Walking Skeleton"][gr8craft 3] 
she referred to, that explains the process too.
While reading more and more of the [c2 wiki] I am asking myself where is the difference
to a [spike][c2 wiki spike] which Kent Beck defined as

> a spike is "end to end, but very thin", like driving a spike all the way through a log

Looks like this is very much the same, isn't it?
