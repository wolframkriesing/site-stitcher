# Alan Kay On Messaging

On the famous [c2 wiki] find ["Alan Kay On Messaging"][56].
His words are from the year 1998 and still so true. 
And I am only close to the beginning of really understanding.
But I have to, as usual, extract some of the key points for me.
Make sure to read the entire message anyways, it's really very short!

This just means: make sure to understand how he means OO should be done. 
Need a starting point? Read [poodr] and listen to [Sandi Metz]'s various talks [findable online][57-1].

Inherently, once scratched on the surface of what OO means and reading about [object calisthenics][57] 
the question what is inheritance will stick out.  
And Alan Key writes about it:

> I would say that a system that allowed other meta things to be done in the ordinary course of programming (like changing what inheritance means, or what is an instance) is a bad design.

Two questions are raised here:
1. What does inheritance mean?
2. What is an instance?

/me has to go and read and answer those ...
And work on improving what he calls to be 

> Given the current low state of programming in general

(which I understand as: most programming done nowadays is "bad" (that's how I interpret "low state") - maybe I am wrong)
