# Cohesion and Coupling explained

Wikipedia says about ***cohesion***, it [*refers to the degree to which the elements of a module belong together*][cohesion].  
And about ***coupling*** it says [*how closely connected two routines or modules are*][coupling].

See below for a [very good short 6min video][58] explaining how and why you should aim for high cohesion and loose coupling!  
And if you want to spend more time watch [this video 57min][59] with all the stars :) discussing this topic more in detail.
