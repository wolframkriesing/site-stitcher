# OO (with Message passing) - explained by Sandi Metz

I have been titled as a [Sandi Metz] fanboy, I am :).
I use "send to" and "plays the role" since I read her book [poodr].

If you are looking for actionable hints about how to do OO right, remember those four:

> Isolate the thing that varies  
> Name the concept  
> Define the role  
> Inject the players  

more info you find in [her railsconf talk][54] linked below where she talks about
 
> Inheritance is for specialization, not for sharing code

and [find here][55] why 

> the IF keeps us from thinking OO 

I also like to quote her on 

> Inheritance is a knife that turns in your hand
