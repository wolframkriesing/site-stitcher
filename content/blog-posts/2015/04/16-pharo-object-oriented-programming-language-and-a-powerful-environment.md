# Pharo - object-oriented programming language and a powerful environment

Pharo - object-oriented programming language and a powerful environment

> Pharo is a pure object-oriented programming language and a powerful environment, focused on simplicity and immediate feedback (think IDE and OS rolled into one).

In the discussion about refactoring etc. at the [Agile Tuesday][52] someone mentioned 
[Pharo][50] which is supposed to be quite advanced in all things, just as the quote above 
mentions. Just watching the first 10min of [this video][51] was enough to be convinced that this
looks really interesting, I am adding it to my "must watch" list :).
