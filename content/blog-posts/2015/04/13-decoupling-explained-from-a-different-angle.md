# Decoupling explained from a different angle

[@KevlinHenney] is always worth watching, so there is [Functional Programming You Already Know][43] by him.
I would like to extract this one piece where [he explains decoupling][44] in a great way, I think.

He says:

> Let me translate "does not care" into computer science language. "Does not care" means decoupling.
