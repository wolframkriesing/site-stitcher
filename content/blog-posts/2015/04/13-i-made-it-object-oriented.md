# "I made it object-oriented"

Another pearl by [@KevlinHenney] in his [Functional Programming You Already Know][43]
is [his explaination of why we actually should leave out prefixes][45] to our functions, such as `get`
and `set`.

At the same time he explains better object-orientation and a more functional style.

> "get" is an imperative word, it's a noise word. But it's an imperative.
> If you want to start thinking about things in an non-imperative way, stop using imperative words.
> The words influence the way you think.

And in case you are also wondering, like me, what "imperative" really means, here is wikipedia's explaination

> imperative programming is a programming paradigm that describes computation in terms of statements that change a program state

And as Kevlin explains some seconds later, very well: "get" means to change something (or move around).
Either 1) move money from one account to another or 2) change or move your marital state from single to married.
But getting a year from a `Date` object does not move/change anything.
