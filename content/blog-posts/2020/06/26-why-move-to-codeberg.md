# Why I Move to Codeberg


## The Trigger
I started learning github actions (and [wrote][3] [about][4] [it][5]). 
Not true, I was reading about them, trying to understand
how they work. I invested one evening, after clarifying [the terms for me][3] 
I figured out that I can go as simple as using some actions
from the github marketplace and be done. But I prefer to understand what's under the hood.
So I did dive in and found that there are [multiple repos](https://github.com/actions) and more,
there is a power behind github actions that seems to go beyond what travis, drone or jenkins offer.

That's when I started to ask myself. **What is my time worth?** Is it worth that I invest my time in
learning github actions?
How applicable is the gained knowledge, the time I invest, outside of the github world?
How much do I need to go into the depth of github actions to make full use of it?
To be honest, I was really happy with travis. Is this just a hip new tool? Does it make
it's job so much better? How much is the deep integration and new approach worth?
Is it open source, so that I can dive deep into it and fix or at least understand the things
that are done under the hood?

## Simplify Things
Over the last years I am tending a lot to simplify things. A big part of my developer life
I have been spending in JavaScript land, I started in 1999 with my first pure JS job.
I have seen the ecosystem grow, I have seen us putting layer over layer on top of one another.
I have seen us forgetting to understand how the browser actually works underneath.
I expected web components to be a much faster and bigger movement than it is. But I believe
many are too busy learning React, which does not really embrace web components (yet).
But web components are built right in the browser and will allow the browser to optimize what
we are optimizing for in the client nowadays. Essentially, we can throw away of the things we
did over the years if we would embrace web components and push their limits.

What does this have to do with codeberg? Well, it looks like a pattern.
But let me dissect the topic a bit more before I come back to this.

The web is COMPLICATED
- lots of layers
- that's why it needs to be simplified!!!
- apply this to my workflow too!

What if I want to have a much simpler workflow? What if I just need a simple server, that I set up
on my own and deploy my static sites onto it? Oh yes, sure I will have to make sure the server runs
and is secure. But I just need a tiny subset of the tooling and I can switch the tooling any time.

## Deeper Into the Rabbit Hole?
Invest my time to learn a tool of one profit-oriented company, to be their messenger?
React, facebook's best recruiting tool.

I closed my tidbit [Is it Github "Actions" or "Workflow"?][3] with.
> Github costs no money. What is the price I am paying?

I took this thought with me. I found even more support for it in [Andreas Shimokawa's](https://codeberg.org/ashimokawa)
talk [Codeberg a free home for free projects][2].
