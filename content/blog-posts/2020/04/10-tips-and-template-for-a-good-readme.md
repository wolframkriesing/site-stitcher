# Tips and Template for a good README

Having a useful and pleasant to read README does sometimes make a difference in deciding to 
spend more time with a package or project. The [tips by James Scott really help][article], 
having [a template like he provides][template] is actually a really good idea. Thanks.

[James Scott][4] who is a technical writer knows how to structure the topic. 
The article covers [what a README is][1], [what should be in there][2] and the I find the part
[Add flare to your README ðŸ”¥][3] quite nice to pep up the entrance to a project.
