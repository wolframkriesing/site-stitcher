# My Learnings

* `npm install <package>@latest` to update to the latest version of a package, 
   no matter the minor, major version, it always goes to the latest
* `diff --recursive <dir1> <dir2>` to diff the files and their contents in two directories
  I just needed to do some golden master tests after updating a dependency
