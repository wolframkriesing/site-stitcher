# imgix.com - imagery for a website

I just stumbled over https://imgix.com  which looks like it could speed up a website building process and reduce the time one needs to invest in preparing images.

The one claim they have somewhere on their website

> Build your product, not the framework

rang with me. It actually well summarizes what they say they offer.
Their service seems to go beyond hosting images on their CDN.
I skimmed over their site and they auto-crop for avatars including face
detection and auto-enhance image quality if desired.

What I don't get yet is how painless and really no-work this will be.
Sounds all good, but also sounds like I would just do the work somewhere else then on my computer.
