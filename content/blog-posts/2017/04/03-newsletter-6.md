# Newsletter #6

This is newsletter #6 - about crafting (and) JavaScript - April 3rd, 2017. Every Monday you will receive a hand-selected collection of **links about JavaScript and how to craft better software**. Let's get started ...

## JavaScript

In "***[Our Best Practices for Writing React Components][react-practices]***" [Scott Domes][scott-domes] writes how he and his colleagues write React components. The post goes quite into detail about how to use what. I suggest pick what is useful and learn what is not. For those who enjoy reading discussion threads this is a treat too :).

WebStorm IDE has received some ***automation features for imports***. We are getting closer to doing less tedious work, bit by bit. JetBrains announced it [via twitter "Sort and clean up your imports with Optimize import (Ctrl-Alt-O) and new code options for JavaScript and TypeScript imports"][imports-webstorm].

***[Next.js is a minimalistic framework for server-rendered React applications][next2]***. To be honest, I didn't quite understand yet what it does. I saw the buzz around it. But I am not sure if it is just a scaffolding tool bundled with other tools, more or something different.

***[Angular version 4.0.0 - invisible-makeover - is now available.][angular4]*** Did you think Angular2 is the latest? You are right, they just switched to semantic versioning, that's why v4 is a v2 :). I have never really used it, but Angular is relevant nowadays.

## Crafting

The japanese railway staff uses a ***[point-and-call] system to prevent (or at least) reduce the number of errors*** they (can) make. They simply combine a physical action, the gesture (pointing) with their duty. For example a speed check is done by pointing at the speedometer and saying out loud "speed check, 80". [Why? Read in this article.][point-and-call] Is there anything we can learn from that for IT (business)?

[Martin] just reminded me about what pair programming is about. "***Pair Programming strategy isn´t 'go faster', it´s 'waste less' (which often results in going faster)***" - Kent Beck. Thanks for the [instructional drawing by Martin Ruprecht][rupis-tweets].

## Various

[Josh Begley][josh] wrote an app that sends a push notification every time a US drone strikes. But that was not as easy as pushing it in the store, Apple has quite an opinion about it. [Read an article about it][apple-metadata-drones-app-accepted].

If you can't make it this week to [SoCraTes Canaries][socracan] you might want to consider the [24th - 27th August 2017 in Soltau, Germany][socrates17]. The mother of all SoCraTes. An un-conference where people like you meet to discuss, shape and share everything regarding the craft of software engineering and more. I am going to the Canaries ;).
