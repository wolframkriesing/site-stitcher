# ADR for documenting decisions

ADR is a way to document decisions, reminds me of python's PEP.

[Lukas' tweet][tweet] made me come across ADR for the first time
so I went to read the suggested [blog post][post].
And it just makes sense to document the decisions, a very simple
process is described in the blog post above and also exactly the
structure of how to go about it. I will keep this around and
maybe it can become one of the tools as the [Mikado method][mikado]
has become a normal thing for me to apply when programming
myself into the rabbit hole :).
