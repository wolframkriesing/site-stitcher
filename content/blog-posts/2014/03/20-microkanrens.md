# Microkanrens

I first heard [@bodil] talk at the 2014 craftconf in Budapest where I saw her presentation 
where she was live coding in at least 10 languages on stage. 

Of course I started following
her on twitter back then and from time to time I recap her tweets just to see what
other interesting are out there in the world of functional stuff that I should look 
at. And there surely is always enough of it that I either never have heard of or that
will cost me another couple of unplanned days to dive into in order to not feel so stupid
anymore :).

Another thing she just posted, I guess preparing for another talk, is [Âµkanrens][35].
They are inspired by [minikanren][33]
 
> an embedded Domain Specific Language for logic programming.

I actually came across because I was once again hunting ES6 stuff. And found 
[some beautiful code in her repo][34]. And I had thought I used many of the new ES6 features :).
