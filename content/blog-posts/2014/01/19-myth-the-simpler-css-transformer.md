# Myth - the simpler CSS transformer?

[Myth](http://www.myth.io/) - a simpler alternative to all the CSS transformers out there?

It currently has a simple set of features: variables, math, colors, 
simpler media queries and some more. But it looks enough to me.
And it is written in JavaScript, no more ruby gem jams.
