Transducers(.js)

> reducing function transformers are getting a name - 'transducers', and first-class support in Clojure core and core.async.

Rich Hickey [invented it](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2014/8/6/transducers-are-coming)

Dive right in [the code on github](https://github.com/cognitect-labs/transducers-js).
