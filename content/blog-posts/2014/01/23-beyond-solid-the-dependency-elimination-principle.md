# Beyond SOLID: The Dependency Elimination Principle

There is always more to learn about any topic, also about SOLID.

> simple pointers to create a clean, intelligible codebase that won't use a lot of dependencies
> - Kill Primitive Obsession
> - Name things as Nouns (and not using verb nouns that have an ‘er’ ending)
> - Remove duplication

First I read his article ["Why I Don't Teach SOLID"][4] where I didn't get his point,
but [the article where the quote above is from][5] does make lot's of sense.
Event though after having read [poodr][6] I can't agree that inheritance will become
unused.
