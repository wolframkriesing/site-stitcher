# Paxos, algorithm to solve the consensus problem

I came across paxos more often lately.
The first time was at a meetup group "Papers we love" 
there was a [meetup in December about paxos](http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Munich/events/213339452/).

> Paxos is an algorithm to solve the consensus problem.
> Paxos is only a small piece of building a distributed database: it only implements the process to write exactly one new thing to the system.

And [this is an explanation and demonstration](http://harry.me/blog/2014/12/27/neat-algorithms-paxos/)
