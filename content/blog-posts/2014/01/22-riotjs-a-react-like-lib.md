# riot.js, a react-like lib

I read it first in my personal trending twitter search, then I saw it on [hacker news][1] 
and I pulled [the repo][2] and being intrigued by the minimal size, compared to react and polymer
I thought I try out the demo, didn't work. So I looked a the code, very opinionated.
My conclusion after having spent about just 1h on it I summed up in [this tweet][3].
