# Markdown used by metalsmith

As I just found in the docs metalsmith, which again uses
[the package metalsmith-markdown](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith-markdown)
which in again uses
[the package marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked)
describes [in the readme](https://github.com/chjj/marked#philosophy-behind-marked)
that is also supports
[github flavored markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).
(I was actually just looking for how to strikeout things :)).
