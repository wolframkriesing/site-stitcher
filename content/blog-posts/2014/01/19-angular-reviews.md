# Angular reviews

Lately they don't turn out so good, or is it my blurred vision?

One by James Shore [An Unconventional Review of AngularJS](http://www.letscodejavascript.com/v3/blog/2015/01/angular_review)
and another by PPK [The problem with angular](http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2015/01/the_problem_wit.html).
