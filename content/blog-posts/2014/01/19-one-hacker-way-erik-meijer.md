# One Hacker Way - Erik Meijer

I really appreciate the things I learnt from Erik Meijer, but I am
not so sure I can follow all his opinions.

He states
[in this talk](http://vimeo.com/110554082).
But nevertheless it's very entertaining!

> Writing tests is waste.
> TDD is for scared people, it's for pussies.

Those statements are actually the funny parts of his talk, though
I am not sure how funny they are meant :).
