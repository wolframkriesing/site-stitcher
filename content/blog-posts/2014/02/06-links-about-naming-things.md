* [Life without a controller, case 1][11] by [@CarloPescio]  
* [Listen to your tools and materials][12] one of the many papers by [@CarloPescio]  
* [The early history of smalltalk][13]  
* [Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns][14] by Steve Yegge    
* [Ask not what an object is, but...][15] by [@CarloPescio]  
* [It Is Possible to Do Object-Oriented Programming in Java][16] by [@KevlinHenney]
