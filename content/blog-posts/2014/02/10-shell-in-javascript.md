# Shell in JavaScript

I don't know why [shelljs] hasn't found me earlier :(

[shelljs]: https://github.com/arturadib/shelljs

This is bash the way I would feel comfortable with it, JavaScript style.  

[Update 2014-02-11] well it's not really all bash can do, it just imitates the interface
using JS as the language. I was looking for the REPL. Well start `> node` and 
there is the REPL :). So I played with it. Not as powerful and far from a 
replacement for bash but it spins quite some ideas.
