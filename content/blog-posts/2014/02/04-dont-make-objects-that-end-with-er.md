# Don't make objects that end with 'er'

I was about to write a "Handler" class. But I remembered that the "er" classes
are not so good.

And I mean, think about it. Even if it is a `RequestHandler` 
it still can do lots of things and can have many reasons to change, which breaks
the Single Responsibility Principle.
So I searched for it and found [this article][8].

now we are getting to the meat :)

A simple example: Loader => LoadRecord

That is so true for a lot of things, and also a good reason why I do believe that
katas have a value.  
Just [read the article][8], it's quite short and compact but has some nice examples in it.
