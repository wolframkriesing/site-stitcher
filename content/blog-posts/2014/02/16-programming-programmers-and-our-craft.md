# Programming, Programmers and our craft

This is a [very nice interview (video)][18] with JB Rainsberger and
Corey Haines, two of the people I closely follow and try to learn from
as much as I can.

They are talking about the passion of being a programmer, how to become one
and how they think that a programmer can become better. They share
a lot of personal experience. Well worth your time.
