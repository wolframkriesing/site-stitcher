# Brand assets - the logo (sets) of a company or service

For [TDDBin] I was just looking for all the icons to use on the website, icons from 
github, trello and twitter to embed them. And I found out that the collection of those
images/graphics are called __brand assets__. Next time you search for them, don't use the term logo, 
use "brand assets".
