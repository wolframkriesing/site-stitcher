The tries I had with "tweeting" from [micro.blog](https://micro.blog) and how it lands on twitter and 
also how I see and can act on replies is still too basic. I know I am twitter spoiled, 
but it's currently my source of information. Should I build my own #indieweb twitter frontend? mmmh

There are some #javascript people around on micro.blog/discover/... :) and somehow the stuff 
I found until now looked interesting, I might try out that bubble a bit more, the micro.blog bubble :)

If I look at all the code (tests=learnings) we created at our #jslang meetups, I think this is quite some knowledge. 
Feel free to dig deeper into it and learn from it, find it all at https://gitlab.com/wolframkriesing/jslang-meetups

what if an code editor had #refactoring as the default when changing variables names, etc. 
and not as a sub-menu item which one has to search for
