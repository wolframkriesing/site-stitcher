# Pseudo-Class `:defined` Under the Hood

The CSS pseudo-class `:defined` is for defined (custom) elements, sure.
But what does "defined" really mean? While reading about [upgrading CBEs](./html-elements-not-upgradable-to-cbes)
I came across the definition for it. Let me [quote the DOM spec a bit](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-element-is-value).  

> An elementâ€™s custom element state is one of "undefined", "failed", "uncustomized", or "custom". 
> An element whose custom element state is "uncustomized" or "custom" is said to be defined. 
>
> [...]
>
> Whether or not an element is defined is used to determine the behavior of the `:defined` pseudo-class.

## What is the "custom element state"?
The [DOM spec has not much on it](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-element-custom-element-state).
It just says when the value is set to what.
There is one [example in the spec that shows the four states](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#example-c5b21302).

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<script>
  window.customElements.define("sw-rey", class extends HTMLElement {})
  window.customElements.define("sw-finn", class extends HTMLElement {}, { extends: "p" })
  window.customElements.define("sw-kylo", class extends HTMLElement {
    constructor() {
      // super() intentionally omitted for this example
    }
  })
</script>

<!-- "undefined" (not defined, not custom) -->
<sw-han></sw-han>
<p is="sw-luke"></p>
<p is="asdf"></p>

<!-- "failed" (not defined, not custom) -->
<sw-kylo></sw-kylo>

<!-- "uncustomized" (defined, not custom) -->
<p></p>
<asdf></asdf>

<!-- "custom" (defined, custom) -->
<sw-rey></sw-rey>
<p is="sw-finn"></p>
```


# HTML Elements not Upgradable to CBEs

[More HTML](https://github.com/more-html/components)
provides a CBE (Customized Built-in Element) for upgrading heading tags such as H1, H2, ...
to render a link-icon beside them, as many know it from github readme files.\
I wanted to upgrade all picostitch sites automatically by just including a `<script>`
which upgrades all headings on the page and adds this functionality.\
**It is not possible to upgrade a parsed and rendered element (like an H1) afterwards.**

There is a very good longer [explanation of that on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51527693).
In short the conclusion is:

> The is attribute is used only at element creation (at parse time) to initialize the is value and has no effect if 
> changed when the element is already created. In that sense is value is read-only.

## What is More HTML?

This is a small early stage project I started a while ago. It ...

> ... provides several web components that just enhance HTML.
  Some are provided as pure web components ala `<more-somecomponent>`
  and others can be used via customized built-in elements (CBEs [read more on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements)), 
  such as `<h1 is=more-h1>`
  which enhances an H1 with certain functionality.
  See the [examples](https://more-html.github.io/components/examples/) for some more in depth explanation and examples.

See the [README](https://github.com/more-html/components).

## What is a CBE?

CBE is the abbreviation for "customized built-in element" and it makes up a part of Custom Elements.
[The spec says](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-elements-customized-builtin-example) 
the following about it.

> Customized built-in elements are a distinct kind of custom element, which are defined slightly differently and used 
> very differently compared to autonomous custom elements. They exist to allow reuse of behaviors from the existing 
> elements of HTML, by extending those elements with new custom functionality.

## What does "upgrade" mean?

"Upgrade" in the context of Web Components or Custom Elements has a specific meaning.
[The spec explains](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-elements-upgrades-examples)
that very well too.

> Because element definition can occur at any time, a non-custom element could be created, and then later become a 
> custom element after an appropriate definition is registered. We call this process "upgrading" the element, 
> from a normal element into a custom element.

# WebStorm: "New File" Creates Directories and File

I saw a video that VS Code creates directories and file when
adding a file named like `dir1/dir2/file.js`, I tried it in WebStorm.
It works.

Just do "New File" (<kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>n</kbd> for me) and type
the full path and all directories needed get created. Cool.
