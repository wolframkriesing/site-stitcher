# JSCodeRetreat #13, Tetris again

It was the second time that we did Tetris as our task for the JSCodeRetreat and I have to say,
that the participants' comment made me realize that we are on the right track.
Though not all comments were purely in favor of Tetris, I think Tetris is the better
task for a (JS) CodeRetreat.
