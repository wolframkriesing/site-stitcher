by [David Pich][david-pich]. This year about 500 people came together to spend two days in a single

that the participants' comment made me realize that we are on the right track.
Though not all comments were purely in favor of Tetris, I think Tetris is the better

        <p>I just wanted to install a github-flavored markdown plugin for vim. 
Until today I only used vim as it falls out of the box. So I had to do a couple 
detours before I got a vim plugin installed. Since I like the simplicity of the Mikado 
Method I apply it very often (maybe too often). In this case I used a very simple form 
of it, actually mainly to document all the steps I had to take on this detour. Read more below.</p>

        <p>I am convinced, that stricter types are of help when writing, reading and understanding source code. Why? Ever had the [primitive obsession][primitive-obsession]? And if you continue down the (type) rabbit whole, you get to stricter typing. And to Purescript, which attempts *&quot;to keep the semantics of JavaScript, while enjoying the syntax and type system of a language like Haskell&quot;*.
